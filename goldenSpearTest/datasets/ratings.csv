"Just received my order today. When I opened the package it appeared used to me. The product packaging was wrinkled and the way it was folded inside looked as if someone had just stuffed in the package. When I took it out of the package to put it on, the velcro wouldn't stick. Upon further inspection I realized that the velco was on the wrong side of the belt. It had ripped off of the correct side and stuck to the fuzzy part, which was proof someone had tried to use it before me and this is what happened.....probably why they returned it. Piece of garbage. Will return it to the store as soon as I can and I will order another brand from another store. Very disappointing because I am carrying twins and working full time. I have been struggling the last week to make it through a work day and was really hoping this would help. Now I have to wait and suffer the pain because I got a defective and used product.",1
"First of all, the button hole on this belt never matched the size of button on the pants I wanted to wear, either too small or too big.  \n\nThe short belt is normally too short, the long belt is too long to go with any pants I have.  And the fabric you are supposed to use to cover the exposed area, it is useless!  Too much fabric to tuck in.  \n\nAfter all, I am in 8th month and never used it, and returned it.  It was far better to use a rubber band in the length you like, and cover the waist line with BeBand, or the longer top.",1
"these didnt hold anything up and was obvious it was there",1
"Nothing else needed to say",1
"This didn't work on most of my pants because the hook wasn't the right size. Way over priced for what you get. I returned it. Just use a hair band. For a couple bucks you have the same effect.",1
"I was really excited to get this product but when I received it I wasn't impressed. This product doesn't stay in place & bunches up. By the time I received it I was unable to return it because my post man delivered it to the wrong address. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this product",1

"I can't tell you if it works or not. I bought the belly bandit's recommended medium (I should have gotten a large) and I can't get it to fit around me. I'm a little upset because it's not chea and I no longer have the return information/paperwork because I measured 2 times, ordered once and just knew it would fit.",1

I'm a little upset because it's not chea and I no longer have the return information/paperwork because I measured 2 times, ordered once and just knew it would fit.",1
"Horrible. Followed washing instruction and shrunk at least 2 sizes. Ridiculous. I'm going to attempt to return I will throw a fit if I'm not able.",1
"The initial fit was brilliant. I got it a size that would be flattering but a bit large in case I wanted to layer. Unfortunately after following the instructions on washing, it became unwearable. Every wash thereafter it continued to shrink, and now it can not even button.",1
"I loved this shirt in the store. I loved the black and white together. Unfortunately, it shrunk a bunch in the length. I washed it in cold and hung to dry and it still shrunk. I would return and re-order, but they are out of my size online and it is sold out in the store. I will probably try to wear tucked in with a cardigan. Too bad.",1
"I followed washing instructions and it shrank a ridiculous amount! Was unwearable-would have fit a four year old. I was furious. I threw it away. What a waste of money. I should have insisted that Target take it back but was afraid I couldn't because I had worn it once and washed it and didn't have receipt. Very disappointing. Don't buy this.",1
"After buying this shirt on clearance I read the reviews here. . . and then I read a bit about Rayon. Evidently most rayon (this included) requires dry cleaning. It can shrink enormous amounts even after being washed in cold water and hung to dry. (See the reviews for Target's other \",1
"First time I washed it the top shrank one size down. I bought a size up so it wasn't too bad except that now it's starting to come unraveled. And not at the seams. In the middle of the back.",1
"Inconsistent sizing! These do not match the size chart provided.\n\nI ordered another pair of size 8 shorts alongside these. The other pair was slightly big, but these are too tight! They don't match the size chart! Why does Target have inconsistent sizing? Both shorts are the same brand.",1
"I know it said 'one size' but the poncho (which is adorable) is gigantic. And not like in the cute-oversized look--- more like I am wearing-a-humongous-blanket-with-arm-holes look. I am very sad.",1
"This is not even remotely a sweatshirt, it's exactly like non-skid area rug padding. I literally had to peel it apart because it was stuck together and stiff. It's going right back to the store.",1
"This top is horrible quality... Before I wore it even once, I washed it in the washing machine and the fringe knotted itself into on giant knot. I couldn't get the knot out without ripping out almost all of the fringe. Now, there are practically seven remaining strands of fringe, the shirt looks horrible, and I wasted $20.",1

"I can't wear these because although the waist band is nice and large, the butt and leg parts of the pants are HUGE! NOT a size small by any means. I feel like they more like a size large. Don't know if Target is assuming that pregnant women are gaining a ton of extra weight??",1
"These were very cute when I put them on, but even prior to washing, they ripped lose along crotch and seams came undone along ankle. Unfortunately I wasn't able to return them. Very bummed I chose these over an actual pair of slacks.",1
"The first time I wore these leggings they came loose at the seam down the back, like another reviewer mentioned. Very disappointed.",1
"Soft and comfortable but definitely sheer when you bend over. Probably ok if you are just walking around but won't be suitable for yoga, Bar Method, or other exercise. Contemplated doubling up, which solves the problem, but that seems too silly. I will be returning these.",1
"These leggings are very tight, hot and make you sweat. I wish I would have taken them back. I bought much better ones from another store.",1
"This shirt rolled up. The straps inside the cup stuck out awkwardly. The fabric started balling after being washed one time. I wish I could return it. But Being a new mom I don't have time to deal with the possibility of not being able to return it. It is garbage. Don't buy it. Such a waste of money.",1
"Fell apart after one wash!!!!!",1
"The sides roll up on you and hurt. No structure to this item.",1

"I have bought these legging 3 times before in the store so I was comfortable buying this pair online. Unfortunately, the first day I wore them they had a run (like pantyhose) all the way up the bottom. I don't want to return them because they have been worn. Just disappointed that I spent that much on one item that I didn't get my money's worth out of.",1
"As I was pulling them up they got a run just like a pair of hose! Never even got to wear them :( I so don't recommend!",1
"The size S/M is supposed to fit a size 0-10.  I am a size 10, 8 months pregnant, and I cannot get these leggings to stay up.  They are constantly falling down, won't stay over the belly and need readjusting all the time.  I feel like the crotch is always down near my knees.  I don't know how anyone smaller could get them to stay on!",1
"Horribly see through. Your have to wear a long shirt,sweater , or dress with them at all times otherwise your underwear sees through. Not worth the buy at all.",1
"Size 12 pre pregnancy and I have the size M L. These are a super comfortable fabric that won't fade and are like wearing pajamas...until you begin walking and they are constantly falling down. I just went shopping in them and had the crotch hanging so low that it was all I could think about. I am going to try with a Belly Band and see if it helps?",1
"I'm 5'3'', 105 lbs pre-pregnancy, now in my 7th month. I bought the small/medium, but I guess I should have known better because I tend more toward extra-small than medium. The big problem for me is the ankles--they are not fitted on me at all. Rather, they hang open at the bottom and look really stupid. I can only wear them if I wear socks over the bottom, which is okay for the winter but won't do for the spring. The legs are also a bit baggy on me. As mentioned by previous reviewers, they are not completely opaque, but that doesn't bother me because I don't wear leggings like pants (they're not pants!) but rather under dresses/long tunics.",1
"I bought a s/m typically wearing a 2 or 4.. The first time I wore these they had a seam separate up the back. Now I can't wear them anymore unless my bottom is completely covered.",1
"I read the reviews before choosing these and they were so off the mark! These are super think, like tights, not leggings at all. I wore them with a long sweater and was afraid to get up from my desk at work all day. Im a size 6 5'5\",1
"Love the material but they don't stay up.  Always ridding down when you walk.  Legs could be a little longer as well.",1
"The leggings are soft but not well made - would not stay up.  Not comfortable because you need to readjust every 2 minutes!",1
"Bloody awful. I got to wash these twice on gentle cycle and already they're full of holes. So much for style and comfort...I got to wear these twice and they look like I was standing too close to a fire already. Swiss cheese pants!",1
"Bought these in the store 3 days ago, wore it once, and there was a run (like pantyhose) in the back. They are extremely thin and very poor quality. I bought the M/L because I normally wear a M in leggings, but these were huge. The crotch area (like others have mentioned) is really baggy and ill fitting. Also the bottom of the leggings are not tight. Maybe I should have sized down to S/M, but didn't want them any more sheer than they already are.",1
"I should've heeded other reviewers advice and passed on these. They did not stay up for even five minutes. I love the tanks from this brand, but the leggings all went back.",1
"Really surprised to find these so uncomfortable because I usually love all things Gilligan & O'Malley. They have this scratchy elastic material on the outer edges that is extremely uncomfortable. Definitely not good for night wear.",1
"These bras had no support. I had size xl and I wear 38 ddd. Boobs falling out bottom. Maybe they'll work for someone with small boobs.",1
"L/XL was so tiny - I'm like 36D and it was so tiny",1
"These pants are basically just thicker material leggings. I purchased online to wear to work and had to return- the lack of pockets definitely make them just look like leggings. Not impressed.",1
"The belly band wasn't elastic enough and kept falling down. They were also weirdly tight in the knees.",1
"I'm not sure how they managed to make these pants both suffocating AND prickly, but they sure did. I returned them about 4 minutes after trying them on.",1

"I was very disappointed with this unsupportive, uni-boob bra. I bought it two weeks before my due date and currently wear a 40G. This bra is not suitable for me at this size, much less after I start nursing and expect to need a larger size. I had to return it in store and order from an expensive, specialty bra store.",1

But Being a new mom I don't have time to deal with the possibility of not being able to return it. It is garbage. Don't buy it. Such a waste of money.",1
"Fell apart after one wash!!!!!",1
"The zipper on this product it of very low quality making it difficult to quickly put on and pump. I bought this so I could pump hands free but found the zipper to be very difficult to correctly zip which means it takes longer to use than if nothing was used (defeating the purpose of it.) It also does not hold the pumps tightly causing poor suction on the flanges and allows breast milk to leak from the bottom if you recline at all. This means I have to lean forward or hold the flanges in place (COMPLETELY defeating the purpose of the bandeau). Overall I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product and it is not what I would expect from Medela for the price paid.",1
"Not really hands-free",1
"I was new to pumping and looking for a hands-free bra. I looked at 2 Targets and they were out of the size I needed and ultimately ended up ordering this bra. I should have believed the reviews. It's aweful! Literally, the zipper broke on my first use. The holes are positioned oddly, at least for me anyways, and this could never have been intended for long term use. I finally got ahold of a Simple Wishes hands-free bra and continued living my pumping life without incident for the next 8 months. Please please please do not waste your valuable time as a new mom purchasing this...you'll just be returning it at some point.",1
"the zipper broke the first time I put it on, so I exchanged it the zipper broke on the next one the second time i used it, I returned it wished it would because it is really nice to have you hands free",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail). But the bandeau/wrap style doesn't work for large breasts. It just squashes them down with no support and you feel them pushed up against your body at the bottom of the bra. Just wearing it temporarily to pump was uncomfortable without any form of support. Same review for the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier. I'll be trying a DIY sports bra next...",1
"The sizes run way too small and the zipper split when I was trying to get it off. It's not worth the money you pay for it.",1
"you need a bra like this but don't get this brand. the zipper broke on both of mine since they used such a cheap one. now i have a [brand name] bra that is much nicer and sturdier.",1
"I was obviously looking for something that would allow me to pump hands free and this is perfect! I am a size 34 D and I got the size medium! It fits perfectly, I have also washed and dried the bustier and it still fits perfectly! I will have to say the very first time I put it on I had a terrible time with the zipper, since the first initial wearing I had no further issues! I love this bustier!!! :)",1
"The very first time I tried this on the zipper broke. Complete waste of money. I should have listened to the other reviews on the poor quality zipper.",1
"There are much better options out there. This bra is much more work than it needs to be. Need to separate shields/flanges from pump to use bra. There are MUCH better bra options out there that allow you to skip the dismantling. Simple wishes hands-free bra is the way to go.",1
"Purchased this bra, since let's be honest, you absolutely need a hands free bra! Was so annoyed when the zipper broke after a week. Target was kind enough to replace it and well the second one's zipper broke as well! I just went out & recently purchased Lanisohn's hands free bra works well, wish I saved the $33 and did that to begin with!",1
"I have tried two sizes. Both were wrong. There is no way I am a Large. I have a small frame and fairly average size breasts. Any way, the zipper broke on each of the sizes I tried. This bustier was very poorly made.",1
"This is a waste of money. I had one and the zipper broke within a few days so I returned it and got another and now the zipper is broken on that one too. I have ended up cutting it's in a old sports bra.",1
"The zipper doesn't line up right, so it's a battle to zip it up. And then on top of that, the seam has ripped. I ended up buying the Lasinoh version and it is leaps and bounds better quality.",1
"Just no support and uncomfortable. disappointed",1
"This bra doesn't offer a whole lot of support. It just let things \",1
"Back it goes. I am normally a 36C. Now at 33 weeks pregnant, I am a 36D. I purchased this bra in a 36D/DD/E, and it while the cups fit snugly, I don't believe they'll give if I expand to a DD or E. Also, the part that wraps around and snaps is at least 2 inches too short. The sizing is WAY off for this bra.",1
"I purchased two Gilligan & O'Malley nursing tanks on Target.com, a black one and a blue striped one. When I unwrapped the blue striped one, it had the most horrible chemical smell! The black one did not have the horrible smell, just this blue striped one.\n\nI washed this blue striped tank once on its own to get rid of the smell, and then again with another load of clothes, but still the awful chemical smell is there AND it made the load of clothes that I washed it with smell horrible as well!\n\nI've just washed it for a third time and am letting it line dry outside to see if that helps any with the smell. So far it hasn't, which is a bummer because the blue stripe pattern is cute and I love how comfy and soft this tank is in black.",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail).

"I thought the stripes would be flattering but they really are not...and if you have a big chest it just sits weird",1
"I bought 2 pairs to wear in the last month and after delivery. I got 3 wears out of each before holes started forming on the waist band and legs. The material does not hold up to wear and washes.",1

"Not true to size.. also not flowy.. it's clingy.. not flattering.",1
"this shirt is very thin not very good quality .",1
"Sooo thin. I honestly think it would push the boundaries of decency to wear in public. C'mon Target, you can do better than this! They're going back.",1
"Very wide and felt abnormally short (above waist!)",1
"This runs very small. I ordered my size, 3X",1
"The shoulders are very wide and the neckline is very low. The fabric is paper thin as well. Also the length is short for someone who is tall. I cannot even wear this without a tank underneath or my entire bra is hanging out!",1
"This shirt is so flimsy almost to the point of being see-through and pretty useless after the first wash.",1
"These are super short in length I am 5 foot 3 and its super short please make these longer in length",1
"Dress is comfortable, cute, and long enough, however becomes discolored in the wash. I washed it on cold with only delicate whites and it showed blueish spotting on the white parts. I returned it, ordered it again, and it happened again. Don't go through what I had to go through if you can help yourself.",1
"The dress I received did not have the black band on the sides of the dress. It was shapeless and frumpy. It was much shorter than I thought it would be and I'm only 5'5\",1
"This dress was shapeless and unflattering.It is very short in legth too.",1
"Opening my package, I almost couldn't recognize the dress that I had originally ordered. Yes, color variance is expected, but as noted in the photos, the colors are extremely different. Unfortunately, the quality of the dress does not live up to the price. Disappointed in the product.. the pictured belt is not included.",1
"Unfortunately this dress was super slinky material. From the close up it looked like this dress was made from a sturdier material. Also, the dress goes to my ankles, I was hoping for a midi length, like in the photo. I got a Large & I am 5' 7\",1
"I had really high hopes for these as they look higher-end with a fun, distressed edge. The fit is so weird. These are not typical skinny jeans. They stretch like crazy, they're extremely long, the bottom sags within one hour, and by the end of the day they are all over the place in terms of fit -- stretched out like cray-cray! I thought maybe buying a size or even TWO sizes smaller would help, but no.\n\nThis was really sad because I love the Ava",1
"Size runs small, normally wear XL, but I ordered 22LR So I can throw in dryer.",1
"I wore once. Washed on cold and dried on low. When I took it out of the dryer it had a large hole in it.",1
"On the model this looks comfy. On me it was a big sloppy mess. It was see through but soft. I thought about trying a smaller size but the material was so thin I couldn't see it working out.",1
"I ordered XXL because I wanted them to be big on me but they shrank so much they fit like they're a large instead of XXL. I even dried them in low heat .",1
"Fabric was too thin..would have to wear a layer underneath.. In the heat of the summer , this is NOT a preference! I returned it .",1

"This top had the style I was looking for. Basic long sleeve t-shirt. But I returned this purchase. Like a lot of knit tops these days, the fabric was very flimsy, almost sheer. Also, typical of the Target fit, the arms seemed to be cut tight to me. I used to love Target clothing, but I think there have been so many compromises on quality and fit over the years to keep costs down that I don't think I will take a chance again ordering sight unseen. And sadly, this shirt was representative of what is in the stores, too, when I went to return it and looked around for a replacement. And it is not just Target, in their defense. Obviously, I am out of step with what other consumers want and expect in Big Box clothing. But to me, Inexpensive clothing has now just become cheap.",1
"it had holes in it the first time I wore it plus runs very large",1

"On the model this looks comfy. On me it was a big sloppy mess. It was see through but soft. I thought about trying a smaller size but the material was so thin I couldn't see it working out.",1
"I wore once. Washed on cold and dried on low. When I took it out of the dryer it had a large hole in it.",1
"This top had the style I was looking for. Basic long sleeve t-shirt. But I returned this purchase. Like a lot of knit tops these days, the fabric was very flimsy, almost sheer. Also, typical of the Target fit, the arms seemed to be cut tight to me. I used to love Target clothing, but I think there have been so many compromises on quality and fit over the years to keep costs down that I don't think I will take a chance again ordering sight unseen. And sadly, this shirt was representative of what is in the stores, too, when I went to return it and looked around for a replacement. And it is not just Target, in their defense. Obviously, I am out of step with what other consumers want and expect in Big Box clothing. But to me, Inexpensive clothing has now just become cheap.",1

"First issue was this shirt is a ribbed tee. Maybe I didnt read the complete description when I purchased, but I don't remember that detail being in there when I purchased. I could deal with it being ribbed, but this shirt is all wrong. The sleeves are too short. In order for it to look right, you need to roll the sleeves up. Also, the shirt itself is too short. You constantly have to pull at it to get it to stay down. What ever happened to the Mossimo Long Sleeved Tees that were out a few years ago???Bring those back!!!",1
"These slide down like no other pants I've ever worn. I can't even wear them casually and stupid me removed the tags after thinking they worked out okay. DONT BUY THESE PANTS.",1
"I ordered XXL because I wanted them to be big on me but they shrank so much they fit like they're a large instead of XXL. I even dried them in low heat .",1
"This shirt ran way too big. The sleeves had no integrity and flopped all around. The chevron design began rubbing off IMMEDIATELY. It was actually insulting that they sold this product. I wore it once more for a diy project, then trashed it.",1

"Very wide and felt abnormally short (above waist!)",1

"great dress!! looks fab!",1
"Opening my package, I almost couldn't recognize the dress that I had originally ordered. Yes, color variance is expected, but as noted in the photos, the colors are extremely different.

I returned it, ordered it again, and it happened again. Don't go through what I had to go through if you can help yourself.",1
"Unfortunately this dress was super slinky material. From the close up it looked like this dress was made from a sturdier material. Also, the dress goes to my ankles, I was hoping for a midi length, like in the photo. I got a Large & I am 5' 7\",1

"These jeans are GREAT. However, I'll be returning them because the stitching needs quality control. A few threads are coming undone near the pockets and the button hole when I pulled the button through the first time ripped about 10 thin strands ... These pants fit SO well but I'm worried they wouldn't hold up for long.",1
"runs very large. super disappointed",1
"I previously returned this skirt in my usual size Medium and replaced it with a Large. This large size is STILL too small for me!",1
"This skirt would've been great except an xxl must mean you're also 7 feet tall! I could wear the skirt as a dress!",1
"Would've been a great skirt, but was more of a dress. If you're a very tall woman, this skirt is perfect!",1
"I ordered a large (in most sizes, I'm between a 10 and a 12) in this skirt and it fits like a medium. If you have round hips/butt, I'd advise you to avoid this item.",1
"I had to take this off almost immediately due to how itchy it is. Also, the chain is a bit more prominent in person making a bit on the gaudy side.",1
"When I first looked , thought great over dress/ blouse sweater. BUT-\nwhen I opened it has a large bulky seam going right down the front of the sweater!\nWhen turning it inside out, took care of the problem BUT-then it had outlandish seams sticking out on the arms. I think someone did not have the parts in right order when sewing item up!!!",1
"Cheap, very thin. Going to be returned.",1
"I'm 5'5 and 130 lbs, and a medium was far too tiny for me. The torso of the suit was so short, the suit wasn't long enough to begin covering my chest. Had to return it. Very disappointed.",1
"I went out on a limb and purchased these without reading a review as there were none but I ordered an XL because of how small certain Target pieces fit me and that was in vain because it really small and just not functional or stylish. I wish they would have put that they were low rise bottoms in the description, I could've saved time and money but of course, I was able to return it to a Target store for a full refund so I have no complaints as I bought them online.",1
"I am planning on returning this shirt. Pretty sure the xs and the xxl are the same length. You realylly need to be about 5'4 to wear this top. :-(",1
"It is a cute shirt but it was way to short and boxy. I returned it.",1
"If you buy this shirt, you will think you're insane once you try it on. The cut is bizarre, circus-tent-like, and fits very awkwardly - snug at top, then giant and formless elsewhere.",1
"This is not even remotely a sweatshirt, it's exactly like non-skid area rug padding. I literally had to peel it apart because it was stuck together and stiff. It's going right back to the store.",1
"I ordered an XS, which I usually order, and couldn't get the shirt over my head! With no zippers on the side or give to the fabric, there was no way I would get this on! It looked cute, so it was frustrating I couldn't put it on.",1
"Too small for an \",1
"This was the biggest size L I have ever purchased. Cute shirt but not wearable in what is my normal size so its going back",1
"Just received my order today. When I opened the package it appeared used to me. The product packaging was wrinkled and the way it was folded inside looked as if someone had just stuffed in the package. When I took it out of the package to put it on, the velcro wouldn't stick. Upon further inspection I realized that the velco was on the wrong side of the belt. It had ripped off of the correct side and stuck to the fuzzy part, which was proof someone had tried to use it before me and this is what happened.....probably why they returned it. Piece of garbage. Will return it to the store as soon as I can and I will order another brand from another store. Very disappointing because I am carrying twins and working full time. I have been struggling the last week to make it through a work day and was really hoping this would help. Now I have to wait and suffer the pain because I got a defective and used product.",1
"First of all, the button hole on this belt never matched the size of button on the pants I wanted to wear, either too small or too big.  \n\nThe short belt is normally too short, the long belt is too long to go with any pants I have.  And the fabric you are supposed to use to cover the exposed area, it is useless!  Too much fabric to tuck in.  \n\nAfter all, I am in 8th month and never used it, and returned it.  It was far better to use a rubber band in the length you like, and cover the waist line with BeBand, or the longer top.",1
"these didnt hold anything up and was obvious it was there",1
"Nothing else needed to say",1
"This didn't work on most of my pants because the hook wasn't the right size. Way over priced for what you get. I returned it. Just use a hair band. For a couple bucks you have the same effect.",1
"I was really excited to get this product but when I received it I wasn't impressed. This product doesn't stay in place & bunches up. By the time I received it I was unable to return it because my post man delivered it to the wrong address. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this product",1

I'm a little upset because it's not chea and I no longer have the return information/paperwork because I measured 2 times, ordered once and just knew it would fit.",1
"Inconsistent sizing! These do not match the size chart provided.\n\nI ordered another pair of size 8 shorts alongside these. The other pair was slightly big, but these are too tight! They don't match the size chart! Why does Target have inconsistent sizing? Both shorts are the same brand.",1

"I can't wear these because although the waist band is nice and large, the butt and leg parts of the pants are HUGE! NOT a size small by any means. I feel like they more like a size large. Don't know if Target is assuming that pregnant women are gaining a ton of extra weight??",1
"These were very cute when I put them on, but even prior to washing, they ripped lose along crotch and seams came undone along ankle. Unfortunately I wasn't able to return them. Very bummed I chose these over an actual pair of slacks.",1
"The first time I wore these leggings they came loose at the seam down the back, like another reviewer mentioned. Very disappointed.",1
"Soft and comfortable but definitely sheer when you bend over. Probably ok if you are just walking around but won't be suitable for yoga, Bar Method, or other exercise. Contemplated doubling up, which solves the problem, but that seems too silly. I will be returning these.",1
"These leggings are very tight, hot and make you sweat. I wish I would have taken them back. I bought much better ones from another store.",1
"This shirt rolled up. The straps inside the cup stuck out awkwardly. The fabric started balling after being washed one time. I wish I could return it. But Being a new mom I don't have time to deal with the possibility of not being able to return it. It is garbage. Don't buy it. Such a waste of money.",1
"Fell apart after one wash!!!!!",1

"I have bought these legging 3 times before in the store so I was comfortable buying this pair online. Unfortunately, the first day I wore them they had a run (like pantyhose) all the way up the bottom. I don't want to return them because they have been worn. Just disappointed that I spent that much on one item that I didn't get my money's worth out of.",1
"As I was pulling them up they got a run just like a pair of hose! Never even got to wear them :( I so don't recommend!",1
"The size S/M is supposed to fit a size 0-10.  I am a size 10, 8 months pregnant, and I cannot get these leggings to stay up.  They are constantly falling down, won't stay over the belly and need readjusting all the time.  I feel like the crotch is always down near my knees.  I don't know how anyone smaller could get them to stay on!",1
"Horribly see through. Your have to wear a long shirt,sweater , or dress with them at all times otherwise your underwear sees through. Not worth the buy at all.",1
"Size 12 pre pregnancy and I have the size M L. These are a super comfortable fabric that won't fade and are like wearing pajamas...until you begin walking and they are constantly falling down. I just went shopping in them and had the crotch hanging so low that it was all I could think about. I am going to try with a Belly Band and see if it helps?",1
"I'm 5'3'', 105 lbs pre-pregnancy, now in my 7th month. I bought the small/medium, but I guess I should have known better because I tend more toward extra-small than medium. The big problem for me is the ankles--they are not fitted on me at all. Rather, they hang open at the bottom and look really stupid. I can only wear them if I wear socks over the bottom, which is okay for the winter but won't do for the spring. The legs are also a bit baggy on me. As mentioned by previous reviewers, they are not completely opaque, but that doesn't bother me because I don't wear leggings like pants (they're not pants!) but rather under dresses/long tunics.",1
"I bought a s/m typically wearing a 2 or 4.. The first time I wore these they had a seam separate up the back. Now I can't wear them anymore unless my bottom is completely covered.",1
"I read the reviews before choosing these and they were so off the mark! These are super think, like tights, not leggings at all. I wore them with a long sweater and was afraid to get up from my desk at work all day. Im a size 6 5'5\",1
"Love the material but they don't stay up.  Always ridding down when you walk.  Legs could be a little longer as well.",1
"The leggings are soft but not well made - would not stay up.  Not comfortable because you need to readjust every 2 minutes!",1
"Bloody awful. I got to wash these twice on gentle cycle and already they're full of holes. So much for style and comfort...I got to wear these twice and they look like I was standing too close to a fire already. Swiss cheese pants!",1
"Bought these in the store 3 days ago, wore it once, and there was a run (like pantyhose) in the back. They are extremely thin and very poor quality. I bought the M/L because I normally wear a M in leggings, but these were huge. The crotch area (like others have mentioned) is really baggy and ill fitting. Also the bottom of the leggings are not tight. Maybe I should have sized down to S/M, but didn't want them any more sheer than they already are.",1
"I should've heeded other reviewers advice and passed on these. They did not stay up for even five minutes. I love the tanks from this brand, but the leggings all went back.",1
"Really surprised to find these so uncomfortable because I usually love all things Gilligan & O'Malley. They have this scratchy elastic material on the outer edges that is extremely uncomfortable. Definitely not good for night wear.",1
"These bras had no support. I had size xl and I wear 38 ddd. Boobs falling out bottom. Maybe they'll work for someone with small boobs.",1
"L/XL was so tiny - I'm like 36D and it was so tiny",1
"These pants are basically just thicker material leggings. I purchased online to wear to work and had to return- the lack of pockets definitely make them just look like leggings. Not impressed.",1
"The belly band wasn't elastic enough and kept falling down. They were also weirdly tight in the knees.",1
"I'm not sure how they managed to make these pants both suffocating AND prickly, but they sure did. I returned them about 4 minutes after trying them on.",1

"I was very disappointed with this unsupportive, uni-boob bra. I bought it two weeks before my due date and currently wear a 40G. This bra is not suitable for me at this size, much less after I start nursing and expect to need a larger size. I had to return it in store and order from an expensive, specialty bra store.",1

"Fell apart after one wash!!!!!",1
"The zipper on this product it of very low quality making it difficult to quickly put on and pump. I bought this so I could pump hands free but found the zipper to be very difficult to correctly zip which means it takes longer to use than if nothing was used (defeating the purpose of it.) It also does not hold the pumps tightly causing poor suction on the flanges and allows breast milk to leak from the bottom if you recline at all. This means I have to lean forward or hold the flanges in place (COMPLETELY defeating the purpose of the bandeau). Overall I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product and it is not what I would expect from Medela for the price paid.",1
"Not really hands-free",1
"I was new to pumping and looking for a hands-free bra. I looked at 2 Targets and they were out of the size I needed and ultimately ended up ordering this bra. I should have believed the reviews. It's aweful! Literally, the zipper broke on my first use. The holes are positioned oddly, at least for me anyways, and this could never have been intended for long term use. I finally got ahold of a Simple Wishes hands-free bra and continued living my pumping life without incident for the next 8 months. Please please please do not waste your valuable time as a new mom purchasing this...you'll just be returning it at some point.",1
"the zipper broke the first time I put it on, so I exchanged it the zipper broke on the next one the second time i used it, I returned it wished it would because it is really nice to have you hands free",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail). But the bandeau/wrap style doesn't work for large breasts. It just squashes them down with no support and you feel them pushed up against your body at the bottom of the bra. Just wearing it temporarily to pump was uncomfortable without any form of support. Same review for the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier. I'll be trying a DIY sports bra next...",1
"The sizes run way too small and the zipper split when I was trying to get it off. It's not worth the money you pay for it.",1
"you need a bra like this but don't get this brand. the zipper broke on both of mine since they used such a cheap one. now i have a [brand name] bra that is much nicer and sturdier.",1
"I was obviously looking for something that would allow me to pump hands free and this is perfect! I am a size 34 D and I got the size medium! It fits perfectly, I have also washed and dried the bustier and it still fits perfectly! I will have to say the very first time I put it on I had a terrible time with the zipper, since the first initial wearing I had no further issues! I love this bustier!!! :)",1
"The very first time I tried this on the zipper broke. Complete waste of money. I should have listened to the other reviews on the poor quality zipper.",1
"There are much better options out there. This bra is much more work than it needs to be. Need to separate shields/flanges from pump to use bra. There are MUCH better bra options out there that allow you to skip the dismantling. Simple wishes hands-free bra is the way to go.",1
"Purchased this bra, since let's be honest, you absolutely need a hands free bra! Was so annoyed when the zipper broke after a week. Target was kind enough to replace it and well the second one's zipper broke as well! I just went out & recently purchased Lanisohn's hands free bra works well, wish I saved the $33 and did that to begin with!",1
"I have tried two sizes. Both were wrong. There is no way I am a Large. I have a small frame and fairly average size breasts. Any way, the zipper broke on each of the sizes I tried. This bustier was very poorly made.",1
"This is a waste of money. I had one and the zipper broke within a few days so I returned it and got another and now the zipper is broken on that one too. I have ended up cutting it's in a old sports bra.",1
"The zipper doesn't line up right, so it's a battle to zip it up. And then on top of that, the seam has ripped. I ended up buying the Lasinoh version and it is leaps and bounds better quality.",1
"Just no support and uncomfortable. disappointed",1
"This bra doesn't offer a whole lot of support. It just let things \",1
"Back it goes. I am normally a 36C. Now at 33 weeks pregnant, I am a 36D. I purchased this bra in a 36D/DD/E, and it while the cups fit snugly, I don't believe they'll give if I expand to a DD or E. Also, the part that wraps around and snaps is at least 2 inches too short. The sizing is WAY off for this bra.",1
"I purchased two Gilligan & O'Malley nursing tanks on Target.com, a black one and a blue striped one. When I unwrapped the blue striped one, it had the most horrible chemical smell! The black one did not have the horrible smell, just this blue striped one.\n\nI washed this blue striped tank once on its own to get rid of the smell, and then again with another load of clothes, but still the awful chemical smell is there AND it made the load of clothes that I washed it with smell horrible as well!\n\nI've just washed it for a third time and am letting it line dry outside to see if that helps any with the smell. So far it hasn't, which is a bummer because the blue stripe pattern is cute and I love how comfy and soft this tank is in black.",1

It's aweful! Literally, the zipper broke on my first use. The holes are positioned oddly, at least for me anyways, and this could never have been intended for long term use. I finally got ahold of a Simple Wishes hands-free bra and continued living my pumping life without incident for the next 8 months. Please please please do not waste your valuable time as a new mom purchasing this...you'll just be returning it at some point.",1
"the zipper broke the first time I put it on, so I exchanged it the zipper broke on the next one the second time i used it, I returned it wished it would because it is really nice to have you hands free",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail). But the bandeau/wrap style doesn't work for large breasts. It just squashes them down with no support and you feel them pushed up against your body at the bottom of the bra. Just wearing it temporarily to pump was uncomfortable without any form of support. Same review for the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier. I'll be trying a DIY sports bra next...",1
"The sizes run way too small and the zipper split when I was trying to get it off. It's not worth the money you pay for it.",1
"you need a bra like this but don't get this brand. the zipper broke on both of mine since they used such a cheap one. now i have a [brand name] bra that is much nicer and sturdier.",1
"I was obviously looking for something that would allow me to pump hands free and this is perfect! I am a size 34 D and I got the size medium! It fits perfectly, I have also washed and dried the bustier and it still fits perfectly! I will have to say the very first time I put it on I had a terrible time with the zipper, since the first initial wearing I had no further issues! I love this bustier!!! :)",1
"The very first time I tried this on the zipper broke. Complete waste of money. I should have listened to the other reviews on the poor quality zipper.",1
"There are much better options out there. This bra is much more work than it needs to be. Need to separate shields/flanges from pump to use bra. There are MUCH better bra options out there that allow you to skip the dismantling. Simple wishes hands-free bra is the way to go.",1
"Purchased this bra, since let's be honest, you absolutely need a hands free bra! Was so annoyed when the zipper broke after a week. Target was kind enough to replace it and well the second one's zipper broke as well! I just went out & recently purchased Lanisohn's hands free bra works well, wish I saved the $33 and did that to begin with!",1
"I have tried two sizes. Both were wrong. There is no way I am a Large. I have a small frame and fairly average size breasts. Any way, the zipper broke on each of the sizes I tried. This bustier was very poorly made.",1
"This is a waste of money. I had one and the zipper broke within a few days so I returned it and got another and now the zipper is broken on that one too. I have ended up cutting it's in a old sports bra.",1
"The zipper doesn't line up right, so it's a battle to zip it up. And then on top of that, the seam has ripped. I ended up buying the Lasinoh version and it is leaps and bounds better quality.",1
"The cup fit and placement in this tank is awkward and the underlying mesh had no give in it. For a nursing mom just getting her body back, it is being returned.",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail).

"I bought 2 pairs to wear in the last month and after delivery. I got 3 wears out of each before holes started forming on the waist band and legs. The material does not hold up to wear and washes.",1
"I purchased two Gilligan & O'Malley nursing tanks on Target.com, a black one and a blue striped one. When I unwrapped the blue striped one, it had the most horrible chemical smell! The black one did not have the horrible smell, just this blue striped one.\n\nI washed this blue striped tank once on its own to get rid of the smell, and then again with another load of clothes, but still the awful chemical smell is there AND it made the load of clothes that I washed it with smell horrible as well!\n\nI've just washed it for a third time and am letting it line dry outside to see if that helps any with the smell. So far it hasn't, which is a bummer because the blue stripe pattern is cute and I love how comfy and soft this tank is in black.",1
"I can't tell you if it works or not. I bought the belly bandit's recommended medium (I should have gotten a large) and I can't get it to fit around me. I'm a little upset because it's not chea and I no longer have the return information/paperwork because I measured 2 times, ordered once and just knew it would fit.",1

I'm a little upset because it's not chea and I no longer have the return information/paperwork because I measured 2 times, ordered once and just knew it would fit.",1
"I can't wear these because although the waist band is nice and large, the butt and leg parts of the pants are HUGE! NOT a size small by any means. I feel like they more like a size large. Don't know if Target is assuming that pregnant women are gaining a ton of extra weight??",1
"These pants are basically just thicker material leggings. I purchased online to wear to work and had to return- the lack of pockets definitely make them just look like leggings. Not impressed.",1
"The belly band wasn't elastic enough and kept falling down. They were also weirdly tight in the knees.",1
"I'm not sure how they managed to make these pants both suffocating AND prickly, but they sure did. I returned them about 4 minutes after trying them on.",1
"I was very disappointed with this unsupportive, uni-boob bra. I bought it two weeks before my due date and currently wear a 40G. This bra is not suitable for me at this size, much less after I start nursing and expect to need a larger size. I had to return it in store and order from an expensive, specialty bra store.",1
"Just no support and uncomfortable. disappointed",1
"I was really excited to get this product but when I received it I wasn't impressed. This product doesn't stay in place & bunches up. By the time I received it I was unable to return it because my post man delivered it to the wrong address. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this product",1

"Not true to size.. also not flowy.. it's clingy.. not flattering.",1
"this shirt is very thin not very good quality .",1
"Dress is comfortable, cute, and long enough, however becomes discolored in the wash. I washed it on cold with only delicate whites and it showed blueish spotting on the white parts. I returned it, ordered it again, and it happened again. Don't go through what I had to go through if you can help yourself.",1
"The dress I received did not have the black band on the sides of the dress. It was shapeless and frumpy. It was much shorter than I thought it would be and I'm only 5'5\",1
"This dress was shapeless and unflattering.It is very short in legth too.",1
"Opening my package, I almost couldn't recognize the dress that I had originally ordered. Yes, color variance is expected, but as noted in the photos, the colors are extremely different. Unfortunately, the quality of the dress does not live up to the price. Disappointed in the product.. the pictured belt is not included.",1
"Unfortunately this dress was super slinky material. From the close up it looked like this dress was made from a sturdier material. Also, the dress goes to my ankles, I was hoping for a midi length, like in the photo. I got a Large & I am 5' 7\",1
"On the model this looks comfy. On me it was a big sloppy mess. It was see through but soft. I thought about trying a smaller size but the material was so thin I couldn't see it working out.",1
"I ordered XXL because I wanted them to be big on me but they shrank so much they fit like they're a large instead of XXL. I even dried them in low heat .",1
"Fabric was too thin..would have to wear a layer underneath.. In the heat of the summer , this is NOT a preference! I returned it .",1

"This top had the style I was looking for. Basic long sleeve t-shirt. But I returned this purchase. Like a lot of knit tops these days, the fabric was very flimsy, almost sheer. Also, typical of the Target fit, the arms seemed to be cut tight to me. I used to love Target clothing, but I think there have been so many compromises on quality and fit over the years to keep costs down that I don't think I will take a chance again ordering sight unseen. And sadly, this shirt was representative of what is in the stores, too, when I went to return it and looked around for a replacement. And it is not just Target, in their defense. Obviously, I am out of step with what other consumers want and expect in Big Box clothing. But to me, Inexpensive clothing has now just become cheap.",1
"I didn't love the drape on this one, but I've got a fuller figure. The fabric is on the thin side, and it drapes easily. However, the blouse that I received had a VERY strong musty smell. It may have been that item or batch, but it was noticeable.",1
"Size runs small, normally wear XL, but I ordered 22LR So I can throw in dryer.",1
"I wore once. Washed on cold and dried on low. When I took it out of the dryer it had a large hole in it.",1

"This top is horrible quality... Before I wore it even once, I washed it in the washing machine and the fringe knotted itself into on giant knot. I couldn't get the knot out without ripping out almost all of the fringe. Now, there are practically seven remaining strands of fringe, the shirt looks horrible, and I wasted $20.",1

"Sooo thin. I honestly think it would push the boundaries of decency to wear in public. C'mon Target, you can do better than this! They're going back.",1
"Very wide and felt abnormally short (above waist!)",1
"This runs very small. I ordered my size, 3X",1
"The shoulders are very wide and the neckline is very low. The fabric is paper thin as well. Also the length is short for someone who is tall. I cannot even wear this without a tank underneath or my entire bra is hanging out!",1
"This shirt is so flimsy almost to the point of being see-through and pretty useless after the first wash.",1
"These are super short in length I am 5 foot 3 and its super short please make these longer in length",1
"I had really high hopes for these as they look higher-end with a fun, distressed edge. The fit is so weird. These are not typical skinny jeans. They stretch like crazy, they're extremely long, the bottom sags within one hour, and by the end of the day they are all over the place in terms of fit -- stretched out like cray-cray! I thought maybe buying a size or even TWO sizes smaller would help, but no.\n\nThis was really sad because I love the Ava",1

"Horrible. Followed washing instruction and shrunk at least 2 sizes. Ridiculous. I'm going to attempt to return I will throw a fit if I'm not able.",1
"The initial fit was brilliant. I got it a size that would be flattering but a bit large in case I wanted to layer. Unfortunately after following the instructions on washing, it became unwearable. Every wash thereafter it continued to shrink, and now it can not even button.",1
"I loved this shirt in the store. I loved the black and white together. Unfortunately, it shrunk a bunch in the length. I washed it in cold and hung to dry and it still shrunk. I would return and re-order, but they are out of my size online and it is sold out in the store. I will probably try to wear tucked in with a cardigan. Too bad.",1
"I followed washing instructions and it shrank a ridiculous amount! Was unwearable-would have fit a four year old. I was furious. I threw it away. What a waste of money. I should have insisted that Target take it back but was afraid I couldn't because I had worn it once and washed it and didn't have receipt. Very disappointing. Don't buy this.",1
"After buying this shirt on clearance I read the reviews here. . . and then I read a bit about Rayon. Evidently most rayon (this included) requires dry cleaning. It can shrink enormous amounts even after being washed in cold water and hung to dry. (See the reviews for Target's other \",1
"First time I washed it the top shrank one size down. I bought a size up so it wasn't too bad except that now it's starting to come unraveled. And not at the seams. In the middle of the back.",1

"While the idea is cute, the rhinestones are not. The lettering is so spaced out, that it makes it incredibly hard to read. The quality of the rhinestones seems pretty poor as well. I would suggest to shop elsewhere for a hoodie (many online stores sell this type of item). However, I did score some super cute Bride sandals from Target!",1
"item terrible color(hot neon pink, not light pink) see thru, and knitted yarn it catches and snags on everything",1
"Cute top...but it runs super small. I'm a petite, and the shirt fits me like a skin tight crop top. Would only fit like the picture if you put it on a toddler. My other Star Wars shirts fit great. I'll be returning my XS for maybe a L or XL, maybe then it'll be longer, and fully cover my midriff.",1
"I thought this would be a perfect top for the leggings tunic boots look. While I loved the way the body of the shirt felt, the detail around the neck and the sleeves are a totally different fabric from the body and are very clearly grey. You can see a slight color variation in the photo, but it's much more pronounced in person. Additionally, the fabric on the sleeves/neck felt similar to a cheap wash cloth. I found this odd since the body was very plush and thick. This went right back to the store.",1
"I ordered an XS, which I usually order, and couldn't get the shirt over my head! With no zippers on the side or give to the fabric, there was no way I would get this on! It looked cute, so it was frustrating I couldn't put it on.",1
"This was the biggest size L I have ever purchased. Cute shirt but not wearable in what is my normal size so its going back",1
"Sleeves are actually long, with elastic at the wrist. They look dorky both all the way down and pushed up like in the photo. The fabric is to heavy for the look, and very hot. The red embroidery is actually a dark rust, not pretty at all.",1
"This shirt is a joke. I bought it because it was absolutely beautiful in the store, but just like most of their nicer blouses, it shrunk about a million sizes. I bought it in a medium because I usually wear a small (5 feet and 4 inches, 125 pounds) and it probably couldn't even fit a 3 year old right now.",1
"It is a cute shirt but it was way to short and boxy. I returned it.",1
"I really wanted to like this since I love skulls and anything anatomy-related. I was really disappointed to see how unfinished this is. The sleeves are literally as if I took a long sleeve shirt and cut the sleeves off. The unfinished hem is fraying and uneven, and the armholes are cut in such a way that the front of my bra shows. I've done DIY t-shirt cutting that turns out better than this. Also, this runs really short. I have a short torso and it was too short on me. It has to go back, unfortunately.",1
"One wash and now it's one size smaller. Waste of money",1
"I give 1 star because it's such a pretty print however it is not worth any dollar. It does in fact run very small. I suggest going 2 sizes up because it is cut small& after 1 wash it shrinks down an entire size. I allowed it to air dry and it still shrunk. Now I have to trash it because it's extremely small now. Waste of money.",1
"I really like this donut and coffee night gown. I am 5'6 and weight 150lbs, I bought a Large but one sleeve is very tight. I am going to exchange it for an XL because I like the funny concept.",1
"This style either runs extremely small or was defected. I ordered an XL and it's smaller than another style size \",1
"I bought this for four people in four different sizes, nobody's fit :/ They run AT LEAST TWO SIZES SMALL. I'm sticking with Nick and Nora.",1
"SHRINKS A TON- BOUGHT THESE FOR ME AND MY KIDS- THEY ALL SHRUNK 2 SIZES!!!! GOOD VALUE AND CUTE BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SHRINKING!!!",1
"shrinks after wash\nbutton holes become loose",1
"Was comfortable, but after washing, the arms are really tight & the front is now too short. Be sure to buy a size or two bigger.",1
"Im a size 6 and bought a small. I washed it and it shrank so much I couldn't wear it. One star for it being cute.",1
"I WILLL RETURN SA THESE COULD HAVE BEEN 2ND HAND FROM THE THRIFT SHOP - WATE OF MONEY AND VERY POOR MATERIAL QUALITY..",1
"I ordered these online, and as soon as they arrived I tried them on to make sure they fit (they did). I then laundered them according to the instructions on tag (wash cold, dry low) and they shrunk like crazy! Not happy at all.",1
"Like another comment said, I tried the pajamas on in the store and they fit great. Took them home, washed them, tried them on again and they shrunk! Noticeable difference in size. I really wanted to like these pajamas because the material is so soft but hate that they shrunk.",1
"Loved the look of these got them on clearance as soon as I saw they were rayon I knew I couldn't put them in the dryer. They still shrunk and I have to iron them to make them wearable. For the full price you charged they should have been cotton",1
"I ordered these pajamas in XXL and they fit like they were size Large.",1

"These are cute, but not $200 cute, which is what I paid for the clothes that were ruined when washed with these pajamas. I washed them with darks before I wore them and they ruined a sweater with that load. Then I washed them again with darks and they ruined a pair of pants. What gives? If you get these pajamas, I suggest you wash them at least three times with a bunch of old towels. And here I thought I was getting a good deal on some great pjs. Get them in a different color.",1
"The set is super cute and soft but my buttons keep popping open. By the time I wake up in the morning, my girlfriends are on show for everyone to see. Maybe I just had a bad set or am I a bad sleeper?",1
"Ordered L/XL it is a medium at best. I am a curvy girl and this is not bigger than a size 8. My daughter is an 8 it fits her perfectly. Size up. If you are larger than a size 8. This robe is not for you. It is pretty if you are very tiny. Mine is going back! I am normally a perfect size 12.",1
"I dried these on low and I've never had something shrink so much. It was like I put them in some sort of shrinking machine. The mediums I got look like a little girl's size now.\nTerrible material. They're awesome until they're washed and dried (again, on low.)\nI guess if you want to baby them and handwash them in cold water and hang them to dry, go ahead. But otherwise, I wouldn't waste the money.",1
"The print is a five! I hate the knit fabric. I buy the 100% cotton nick & Nora pjs regularly. I thought that was what I was ordering. When they arrived and were a synthetic fabric, I promptly returned them. Target, what are you thinking? If cotton is too expensive at the $29.99 price point, then charge more. They would still be a great value. When you live in very humid South Florida you do not wear synthetic fabrics!",1
"This style either runs extremely small or was defected. I ordered an XL and it's smaller than another style size \",1
"I am disappointed because these are so cute, but extremely thin! I'm talking people can easily see the pattern on your underwear. What a shame because the pattern is super cute. Looks like I'll have to return them.",1
"The pajama pattern is ridiculously cute and the fabric is comfy--- but it's also so thin that it provides minimal warmth; and even worse, you can very easily see one's underwear.\nThe top it comes with is too short to add any extra coverage to your lover region beyond the bottom of the waist and above the tush, so you have to find a longer top to wear to cover that region up if you want to wear these pajamas.\n\nAdditionally, there's no way to tighten the waist line, nor is there any elastic. This is bad enough even for 'regularly' built folks because everyone has at least somewhat of a differing waistline-- but it's even harder for me, because I have a naturally larger tush and a naturally smaller waist-- which means that I need a notably bigger pair to fit my tush properly, but I'm left with a ton of excess fabric around the waist which causes all kinds of issues and unsightly bulges under my long fitted shirt.",1
"I never even got to wear these, I will be returning them promptly. I washed them once and they bled terribly. Obviously the manufacturing didn't set the fabric correctly. Very disappointed in these pajamas. I thought they were really cute. Too bad.",1
"I bought these last week and loved them in the store. As another reviewer said, I never even got to wear them. :-( I washed first (as per care tag) and the red trim ran all over the place. They are going right back to the store. Sad because they are super cute.",1
"the pajamas are soft and the print is really cute, but the quality is terrible.\nI hand washed these in cold water with detergent and hung to dry and the red trim bled into the the printed area.",1
"Washed these the day I purchased them and the red lining bled all over the pjs. Disappointed.",1
"I should have listened to the earlier reviews. Bled terribly after being washed once in a cold water. Do not waste your money.",1
"Comfy and cute, unfortunately the red pipin bleeds all over. Had to return after first wash.",1
"Pants are short and the top barely covers your stomach. In the picture the pants are long and the pants go past the but.",1
"Adorable pjs, but when I washed them, they shrank almost 2 sizes.",1
"I loved the pattern, color, cut and texture of these PJ's. The fit and length was perfect and loose/baggy enough as PJ's should be (as shown in the picture).\n*** BEWARE***\nWhen I washed them (exactly as the tag suggested), they shrunk considerably to the point that I can no longer wear them (shrunk more than a couple inches - arms and legs length, tight in the bust area and is now showing my stomach). Looks like a child's PJ's now. Very very disappointed.\n\n25$ down the drain! HORRIBLE BUY.",1
"My daughter and I bought matching PJs and LOVED them - I had to bribe her to change out of them - until I washed them. Being 5'9, I'm used to them shrinking in the legs after washing them, so I made sure to wash in cold water and dry on low heat.....they came out 1-2 sizes smaller than they went in. I was SO disappointed!!! I ended up giving her my size L (she was a M) and now we're going to have to find some small child that would like her size M that now fits her like crop pants. Really poor quality...such a shame",1
"The pajamas shrunk in the wash so much I couldn't wear them anymore and I followed the instructions; too back because everything else about them seemed great.",1
"I LOVED these pjs when I purchased them in the store. Such a cute pattern and they fit perfectly. Loose and comfy like the picture shows. Like others I washed them according to the care instructions on the tag. They shrunk 1-2 sizes and now look horrible. They are no longer wearable. Such a freaking waste of money. SO disappointed!",1
"I wish I had seen the reviews online, but unfortunately I purchased these in the store. When I first bought the size small the top was so large and bottoms a little snug, but I just chalked that up to having a larger bottom. Now after one wash on cold and tumble dry low, it's like I'm wearing clamp digger boots pants and a short shirt. Absolutely horrible. Wish I could get my money back, this is such a waste.",1
"DON'T BUY THESE PJS. WORST SHRINKAGE EVER! I thought I found the perfect PJs, they fit so well. I washed exact to instructions, shrunk so bad they would now fit a pre-teen maybe. I have to donate them. I spent full price on these. I'm so disappointed. Looks like other reviews are the same. I wish I could get me money back :(((.",1
"Should have read the reviews! Luckily one of my younger daughters can now wear them.",1

"This bathrobe makes you look twice your size since it is lined with a terry cloth insert. The outside fabric doesn't feel like quality fabric, especially for an $80 robe. As you can imagine, I returned this robe.",1
"This looked like a cute sleep set, but when it arrived, I was surprised how heavy the material was. When you design/manufacture shorts and a short-sleeved shirt for sleeping, the material should fit the style and intent - cool temperature sleeping. Returned.",1
"So, I bought a women's set and a men's set of these adorable Christmas pajamas at full price - $29.99 very recently. And, also a child's set so we would all have matching Christmas pajamas to wear to an event that is coming up. I washed them to get them ready to wear and the red dye color on the 2 adult pair bled pretty bad so that all of the white parts - Santa, etc are now pink!! :-( Really not good! And, I followed the washing instructions on the tag as well. The child's pair was fine - maybe because it is polyester, not sure. I am very disappointed and thank goodness that I washed them alone and not in a full load of other clothes because all of our clothes would have been ruined. And, I came back on here to write the review and see that they are now on sale for only $17.99!!! Needless to say, I am really not happy and not sure what to do now!!! :-(",1
"We are big fans of the Nick and Nora Pajamas and get a couple new pairs each year, and have, until now, been very happy with them. This year is a huge exception. I washed mine in cold water and line dried them and they still shrank significantly. Please have someone do a shrink test on the fabric next year and follow up with quality control. Also, we all prefer the two patch pocket style over the single narrow breast pocket. Not sure what you could put in it. Maybe a flip phone? Anyway-overall this was a cute set but we all should have ordered a couple of sizes up.",1
"These are ADORABLE but after wearing them for a couple of hours I noticed it had three holes in different areas. I called the store and they said they wouldn't exchange them because they'd been worn. Not purchasing this brand anymore, and much less at that specific Target. Cheap, cheap material",1
"I bought this for four people in four different sizes, nobody's fit :/ They run AT LEAST TWO SIZES SMALL. I'm sticking with Nick and Nora.",1
"SHRINKS A TON- BOUGHT THESE FOR ME AND MY KIDS- THEY ALL SHRUNK 2 SIZES!!!! GOOD VALUE AND CUTE BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SHRINKING!!!",1
"Was comfortable, but after washing, the arms are really tight & the front is now too short. Be sure to buy a size or two bigger.",1
"Im a size 6 and bought a small. I washed it and it shrank so much I couldn't wear it. One star for it being cute.",1
"I WILLL RETURN SA THESE COULD HAVE BEEN 2ND HAND FROM THE THRIFT SHOP - WATE OF MONEY AND VERY POOR MATERIAL QUALITY..",1
"I ordered these online, and as soon as they arrived I tried them on to make sure they fit (they did). I then laundered them according to the instructions on tag (wash cold, dry low) and they shrunk like crazy! Not happy at all.",1
"Like another comment said, I tried the pajamas on in the store and they fit great. Took them home, washed them, tried them on again and they shrunk! Noticeable difference in size. I really wanted to like these pajamas because the material is so soft but hate that they shrunk.",1
"Loved the look of these got them on clearance as soon as I saw they were rayon I knew I couldn't put them in the dryer. They still shrunk and I have to iron them to make them wearable. For the full price you charged they should have been cotton",1
"I ordered these pajamas in XXL and they fit like they were size Large.",1
"Strangely, the photo for this item shows a model with hands in her pockets. There are NO pockets in these pants. I'll be returning them.",1
"One wash and now it's one size smaller. Waste of money",1
"I give 1 star because it's such a pretty print however it is not worth any dollar. It does in fact run very small. I suggest going 2 sizes up because it is cut small& after 1 wash it shrinks down an entire size. I allowed it to air dry and it still shrunk. Now I have to trash it because it's extremely small now. Waste of money.",1
"I really like this donut and coffee night gown. I am 5'6 and weight 150lbs, I bought a Large but one sleeve is very tight. I am going to exchange it for an XL because I like the funny concept.",1
"These are cute, but not $200 cute, which is what I paid for the clothes that were ruined when washed with these pajamas. I washed them with darks before I wore them and they ruined a sweater with that load. Then I washed them again with darks and they ruined a pair of pants. What gives? If you get these pajamas, I suggest you wash them at least three times with a bunch of old towels. And here I thought I was getting a good deal on some great pjs. Get them in a different color.",1
"The set is super cute and soft but my buttons keep popping open. By the time I wake up in the morning, my girlfriends are on show for everyone to see. Maybe I just had a bad set or am I a bad sleeper?",1
"Ordered L/XL it is a medium at best. I am a curvy girl and this is not bigger than a size 8. My daughter is an 8 it fits her perfectly. Size up. If you are larger than a size 8. This robe is not for you. It is pretty if you are very tiny. Mine is going back! I am normally a perfect size 12.",1
"I dried these on low and I've never had something shrink so much. It was like I put them in some sort of shrinking machine. The mediums I got look like a little girl's size now.\nTerrible material. They're awesome until they're washed and dried (again, on low.)\nI guess if you want to baby them and handwash them in cold water and hang them to dry, go ahead. But otherwise, I wouldn't waste the money.",1
"The print is a five! I hate the knit fabric. I buy the 100% cotton nick & Nora pjs regularly. I thought that was what I was ordering. When they arrived and were a synthetic fabric, I promptly returned them. Target, what are you thinking? If cotton is too expensive at the $29.99 price point, then charge more. They would still be a great value. When you live in very humid South Florida you do not wear synthetic fabrics!",1
"This style either runs extremely small or was defected. I ordered an XL and it's smaller than another style size \",1
"I am disappointed because these are so cute, but extremely thin! I'm talking people can easily see the pattern on your underwear. What a shame because the pattern is super cute. Looks like I'll have to return them.",1
"The pajama pattern is ridiculously cute and the fabric is comfy--- but it's also so thin that it provides minimal warmth; and even worse, you can very easily see one's underwear.\nThe top it comes with is too short to add any extra coverage to your lover region beyond the bottom of the waist and above the tush, so you have to find a longer top to wear to cover that region up if you want to wear these pajamas.\n\nAdditionally, there's no way to tighten the waist line, nor is there any elastic. This is bad enough even for 'regularly' built folks because everyone has at least somewhat of a differing waistline-- but it's even harder for me, because I have a naturally larger tush and a naturally smaller waist-- which means that I need a notably bigger pair to fit my tush properly, but I'm left with a ton of excess fabric around the waist which causes all kinds of issues and unsightly bulges under my long fitted shirt.",1
"I never even got to wear these, I will be returning them promptly. I washed them once and they bled terribly. Obviously the manufacturing didn't set the fabric correctly. Very disappointed in these pajamas. I thought they were really cute. Too bad.",1
"I bought these last week and loved them in the store. As another reviewer said, I never even got to wear them. :-( I washed first (as per care tag) and the red trim ran all over the place. They are going right back to the store. Sad because they are super cute.",1
"the pajamas are soft and the print is really cute, but the quality is terrible.\nI hand washed these in cold water with detergent and hung to dry and the red trim bled into the the printed area.",1
"Washed these the day I purchased them and the red lining bled all over the pjs. Disappointed.",1
"I should have listened to the earlier reviews. Bled terribly after being washed once in a cold water. Do not waste your money.",1
"Comfy and cute, unfortunately the red pipin bleeds all over. Had to return after first wash.",1
"Pants are short and the top barely covers your stomach. In the picture the pants are long and the pants go past the but.",1
"Adorable pjs, but when I washed them, they shrank almost 2 sizes.",1
"I loved the pattern, color, cut and texture of these PJ's. The fit and length was perfect and loose/baggy enough as PJ's should be (as shown in the picture).\n*** BEWARE***\nWhen I washed them (exactly as the tag suggested), they shrunk considerably to the point that I can no longer wear them (shrunk more than a couple inches - arms and legs length, tight in the bust area and is now showing my stomach). Looks like a child's PJ's now. Very very disappointed.\n\n25$ down the drain! HORRIBLE BUY.",1
"My daughter and I bought matching PJs and LOVED them - I had to bribe her to change out of them - until I washed them. Being 5'9, I'm used to them shrinking in the legs after washing them, so I made sure to wash in cold water and dry on low heat.....they came out 1-2 sizes smaller than they went in. I was SO disappointed!!! I ended up giving her my size L (she was a M) and now we're going to have to find some small child that would like her size M that now fits her like crop pants. Really poor quality...such a shame",1
"The pajamas shrunk in the wash so much I couldn't wear them anymore and I followed the instructions; too back because everything else about them seemed great.",1
"I LOVED these pjs when I purchased them in the store. Such a cute pattern and they fit perfectly. Loose and comfy like the picture shows. Like others I washed them according to the care instructions on the tag. They shrunk 1-2 sizes and now look horrible. They are no longer wearable. Such a freaking waste of money. SO disappointed!",1
"I wish I had seen the reviews online, but unfortunately I purchased these in the store. When I first bought the size small the top was so large and bottoms a little snug, but I just chalked that up to having a larger bottom. Now after one wash on cold and tumble dry low, it's like I'm wearing clamp digger boots pants and a short shirt. Absolutely horrible. Wish I could get my money back, this is such a waste.",1

Seemed boxy, but to be perfectly honest I would've been able to fit into the large and I ordered extra large, so that might have been contributing to the boxy look. Plus side is that it is very soft!",1

"There's a difference between 'womens 18' and 'misses 18'. When the jeans arrived, they are clearly labeled 'misses 18' on the inside tag. If you're expecting a womens' 18 , don't order these. ..they won't fit.",1
"When I purchased these jeans I had hoped that they would be like the Denizen Totally Shaping jeans - but these fit like a glove.  It is my understanding that Target is the only one that sells these and as I am 72 I really don't want the jean that fits that way.",1
"I'm so disappointed that Target discontinued Merona jeans. Those were my favorite stand-by jeans. I decided to try these out, but will have to return both pairs that I bought. These run very small, even one size up did not fit. They are also not mid-rise but more of a low-cut jean. Quality is good, but the fit is all wrong. Bummed.",1
"This is most definitely NOT a high rise, not even a medium rise. Product information is incorrect.",1
"These are not skinny jeans, these are jeggings. They're comfortable, but they look like cheap jeggings, and they cost too much to look like cheap jeggings.",1
"ITEM: Black Skinny Leg Modern Fit - Crafted by Lee jeans\n\nReview: Jeans - I received a free sample of these jeans for review and evaluation. I evaluated this pair of jeans for fit, comfort, construction, and durability. The color was a deep black.\n\nSize/Fit: I found the fit to be true to size for the waist and hip area. The calf area was tight but the light weight material allowed for flexibility.\n\nComfort: The material was extremely soft and did not hold the shape well.\n\nConstruction: I found all the seams to be double stitched, tightly sewn and finished.\n\nDurability: I have washed the jeans 4 times. The color faded immediately. Also, the jeans stained my skin during the first wearing even though they were washed. Note, this did not happen after the second washing.\n\nOverall this is product was not a favorite.",1
"I normally wear a 14/16 and ordered a size larger as per reading the reviews. They fit great! Waste is a bit big but i always wear a belt so its no big deal. I'm almost 6' and they are a good length for booties or to tuck in tall boots. Also will look cute with flats as the weather warms. Great dark color. Super comfortable with some stretch.",1
"I am 5'5\",1
"The fit was fine, it was the fading that I didn't care for. I will be returning these.",1
"Fit was terrible, not even close to true to size, these are supposed to be jeans for WOMEN not pre teens, I wouldn't suggest them to anyone that isn't a size 6 or 8, NOT cut to fit a woman.\nRetuned them the same day as received.",1

"I have a pair of Denizen bootcut jeans which I love. I ordered these thinking straight leg would do. However, these are more skinny leg. The calves were so tight I could not even attempt to get the top buttoned although I think it would be too tight there also. If you don't mind the tight calves, I would still go up a size. Also they are not jean, not more twill weight. Will still buy regular Denizen jeans in bootcut.",1
"I ordered these jeans thinking they were womens and as it turned out they are Misses. Now I have to go through the trouble of returning them to the store because they were advertised incorrectly.",1
"These jeans were advertised as bootcut but they are not! The tag on the jeans says straight leg but they are slightly tapered and I would consider these more of a skinny jean style. This was a disappointing purchase.",1
"Thank you Target for free shipping and no hassle returns. The only way I'll buy pants because even size 2, a bad fit doesn't work.\nThese have a mid-waist and they tighten up as though your body's waist is there. Nope. These went back.",1
"Unless you plan on wearing these pants only 1 time and never washing them, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Yes, they are \",1
"These pants are so comfy. Unfortunately, the elastic stitching unraveled the first day I wore them. Such a shame. They would have been great lounging pants. I'm taking them back.",1
"I loved the pants when I got them but they didn't even last one wear! While I was wearing them for the first time I noticed the stitching on the waist was coming apart. By the end of the day they were ready for the garbage....and mind you all I did all day in them was go shopping at Target!",1
"As soon as I got these, I tried them on. They are a little thin, definitely not going to keep anyone too warm. When I took them off, my socks (previously white) were pink! This is a terribly made garment. What were they thinking?? I will be returning these pants as I am disappointed in the dye running AND the thin material. These also run small in my opinion.",1
"After a few washes the pants are worn down....you can see through them now. It's a shame because they were super cute and comfy but not worth anything if you can't wear them more than a few times",1
"These are super cute and comfortable, but I have washed them many times. and the dye continues to rub off on me, the floor, furniture or anything it touches. It's like a powder.",1
"The pants are super cute, I loved the color, they're light and comfy, but I bought them just few weeks ago, washed twice and seem like they are old.\nThe first time I used I got my hands and nails all blue, so I read the reviews here and other customers said we should wash them first, to remove the blue thing. But now I can see that the blue thing was the pants falling apart already!\nI can see of my underwear through them. Maybe I can use them as pajamas. Bah.",1
"I bought these pants because they looked really comfortable and I love marvel. But I cant stand to wear them , the black lint just wont stop rubbing off! it gets all over you even after washing them several times.",1
"Talk about garbage quality! After only one wash and 5-6 wears, the knees and crotch have worn through so thin you could read the newspaper through it. Not to mention the pilling, and extreme shedding of gray lint that has gone on for days.",1
"Wore these once before washing. After being washed (according to the direction) the color bled and now are unwearable. Waste of money!",1
"Very, very low riding, and very short in the crotch. Hated them. Returned them. Lovely fabric, bad design and cut.",1
"At only $20 a pair, I thought of getting these in every single color and pattern...SAVE YOUR MONEY! These are awful. Just awful. Comfy and long until you wash them. Mine shrunk 5 inches and look so awful.. They are now coming apart and I am so angry I even bought them!!! Don't waste your money on these or any palazzo pants at Target. They are all horrible.",1
"I bought these for a business trip to Florida- with the slightly dressy look of the fabric and flat front, I could wear them to dinner and on the plane. They were nice and lightweight and the loose fit was flattering. I put them on for my flight and was very comfortable. Mid-way through the flight I stood up and realized that the entire front seam had unraveled and my skin was showing through! Thank goodness I had a long shirt, or the whole plane would have seen my underwear. When I made it to the hotel, I discovered that the side seam had also started to pull apart. I guess I'm lucky that they didn't just fall into shreds. If you're looking for pants that can be worn for less than 6 hours before they self-destruct, these are the pants for you. Since the fabric is jagged where the seam unraveled, I can't even sew them back together.",1
"I bought these pants, wore them once and the seam on the side completely came undone. NO, this is not due to any other reason but lack of quality. There is another review that says the same thing happened to them...it's true. Don't waste your money on this because it will most likely happen.",1
"Unraveled after a few hours of wear. Just like the other two ladies, had a misconception that these nice looking pants were going to be a great addition to our wardrobe, but instead it ended up in the trash. What a waste of money! It's one thing if we can mend the seams that unraveled, but we can't! Save your money....do not buy these pants!",1

Put them on today for the first time this morning & before I could even get out of the house there was sequins EVERYWHERE & all the sequins from my thighs and side of my legs all fell off (& all of this was just from finishing getting ready this morning)! So disappointed and embarrassed couldn't even leave the house in them & was so excited to wear them today for work! Will be returning this first thing tomorrow morning..

"I bought these shoes back in april of this year.I needed something for work since i'm on my feet a lot.These were on sale and I liked the look. Not even 30 days in they started falling apart.The stitching is very poor on these shoes.A small hole formed where my baby toe is on the right foot and one on my left foot.It was very e-embarrassing.I'm angry because money is tight and I had to wait until june to get another pair.I did not want to buy another pair SO SOON!!!",1

"First of all, the socks I received are completely different than the ones pictured. I received two regular white pair and two pair with zebra striping. I was going to just let it go because I'm using them for working out/walking after all, but the quality of these things are absolutely horrid. I have worn 3 pair so far and after the first wear, not 1 but all 3 pair have developed. Large hole in the toes of both feet! I understand these aren't expensive socks, but id expect more than one wear out of these socks! What a bummer!! I have to purchased different socks now because I'm sure the 4th pair will tear as well after they are worn. I do plan on contacting Target about these to see if they are willing to do anything about this, as I am a long time and frequent customer. I would keep searching for some good and more expensive socks if I were you! Unfortunately I had to give these at least 1 star to write this rating, but they don't even deserve that much.",1

"I would give this bathing suit zero stars if possible. The crotch in this suit is about 5 inches wide - I'm not exactly who they had in mind when they made this - maybe a Barbie doll - but certainly not me. You need to have at least a 5 inch thigh gap or else this bathing suit, because of the width of the crotch and the way they stitched the crochet front - or else you will end up like me with a serious case of chub rub (aka chafing). While the bathing suit was very pretty on and I did like the style, I ended up throwing it out. After a day of snorkeling and swimming, my thighs were rubbed raw because of the material.",1

"I never have a problem with sunglasses being too big as I have a pretty big head but these are terrible , really loose and the constantly slide down very annoying ! Disappointing Cuz they r pretty cute !",1
"The are cheaper in person than in the pics online. They have lightweight plastic with wobbly weak hinges and the sides are very cheap looking. These ARE POLARIZED. I have a test card and they passed the test. But, there are so many better oversized women's sunglasses out there that are polarized at half the price and much higher quality frames/lenses. These are not worth the price.",1
"The online description says they are 5.5 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. They are actually 5 inches wide and 1.75 inches tall. This is a pretty important when buying online, and needing specific information about the size of items. They're really cute glasses, but they don't fit my face.",1
"I can't give these glasses 0 stars because that rating doesn't exist. The bottom of the frame broke under the lens literally 2 days after I bought them. And I was making sure to take good care of them considering they were brand new. NOT worth the price at all.",1
"I loved the way these looked on me, but just days after I got them, the tortoiseshell wrap started to peel and flake off around the bridge of the nose and where they hit behind the ear. Annoying, but it was subtle enough I could ignore it. Then one day the arm randomly fell off at the hinge, and the screw was nowhere to be found! I didn't beat these up, just put them in a pouch in my bag. I dropped them once, but there was no apparent damage at the time. However, they didn't even last me a month. I've bought Target sunglasses before and have never had such a problem. \nTerrible, terrible quality, and such a shame because they are so cute!",1
"Total bummer I came online to see if these were sold on the web since the ones I had purchased in the store broke after only about 3 weeks of minimal use. I had the same experience as the previous reviewer! The glasses are totally cute but after only about three weeks one arm peeled off and just broke away! I was going to try and find another pair thinking I just had a bad pair but not after the other reviewer had the exact same problem. Total bummer I loved these!",1
"I loved these sunglasses....I bought them 4/10 at my local store and they broke 5/3...I WAS SO MAD. The frame snapped after they fell ON THE BEACH..that sand, really hard, breaking stuff. very upset and i don't even know who to go to...I spent $17 on these, I better get a replacement",1
"In the past month, these sunglasses have disassembled themselves twice inside my bag.  The right screw has somehow worked its way out and that earpiece has fallen off, leaving me to scramble to find a screwdriver and reassemble them on my way out the door.  The curve of the sunglasses is also exactly wrong - the top has a strong tendency to suction itself to my forehead, and the glasses immediately start steaming up.  I'm very disappointed in this product, and will be replacing them ASAP.",1
"They are just too big for girls. They fit me but I am an grown up woman. I bought them for my daughters.",1
"they sucked. returned.",1
"The lenses look nothing like shown in the picture",1
"Not a nice set of gloves. Would not purchase again or recommend.",1
"This arrived rolled up in a ball completely wrinkled and flattened. It is so wrinkled there is no way to straighten it out. You cannot iron it. This hat does not look anything like the picture. The fabric is so thin it looks cheap and there is no fullness to it al all. This will not stand upright like the picture. Very poor quality control here. I really wanted to give this a positive review. It looked so cute in the picture. Best of luck in finding what's right for you.",1
"The title of my review says it all. Very thin lightweight yarn means no warmth. I would rate it higher for style, but it runs so small I could not get it on my head to see how it looked. The picture makes it appear thicker but it is very loosely knit and thin yarn, therefore not warm in the least. Overall very disappointing. Will definitely return.\nThis is the second knit hat from Target that I've tried, and both are very cheaply made and poor quality. I'll buy my hats elsewhere from now on.",1
"Disappointed!!! I had been searching for a pair of reasonably priced leather zip touch gloves. I fell in love with these but when I tried to use them with my smartphone they didn't work at all so I returned them. They were excellent just didn't do what they were supposed too with the smartphone.",1
"This hat didn't really fit. I did have braids at the time so that may have played a part, but I didn't want to chance it and keep it.",1
"This hat fit my teenager who has a very small head. Looked ridiculous on me as it was so small. I returned it.",1
"This hat is so comfortable and keeps my ears and neck warm. I especially like the rim on the front so it does not look like a beanie",1
"I was looking for a floppy felt hat after seeing them in all of the department stores. I tried on a cute Merona hat in the store but it was damaged. I thought this would be similar but it's too floppy. The brim has no shape. The sides flop down to my ears. I wish they had the Merona floppy hat in brown on the website.",1
"I bought two colors, black and light grey, but the black one was of completely different quality. It was a fuzzy mess, very thin, cheap yarn, and honestly just completely awful. It was scratchy and uncomfortable. I returned the black but kept the light grey one because of the quality difference.",1
"The brim of this hat bends in half, giving it an odd shape. It definitely didn't fit my face right.",1
"Cute style but the yarn is very poor quality. It will pill and attract all kinds of lint. Yarn already looked dirty and used when I picked it up. Will be returning it.",1
"this hat looked really cute online, but when my daughter received it, it was bent out of shape and had no form. She is going to return it. She also felt very funny wearing it.",1

"Wore it for a few hours day on vacation and realized it had this peculiar smell. Like it was coated in some chemical. Decided to hand wash it gently to get rid of the smell, followed washing instructions to a T. Smell did not go away. It's been two weeks. Even attempted to re-shape the hat after the wash, but it will not get back to its original shape. Poor quality. Bad smell. Will attempt to return to the store and hope they take it back.",1
"According to the sizing chart, I ordered a medium for a shoe size 9. When they arrived, the tag said size 7-8. So they will definitely be too small. Also the toes were dirty and due to time constraints I wasn't able to return so I did my best to clean them.",1
"When I first seen this shoe in the new spring collection I was so excited! I thought they were fun and fabulous for the summer. However, my second time wearing them the top of the shoes (straps) rubbed the skin off the top of my feet! Ouch....I will not be in pain being cute! So disappointed and I plan to return these shoes!",1
"I ordered these online because they looked stunning. The problem I normally have with shoes is that they are too tight - I have a wide foot. These are HUGE. I mean ridiculously huge. I can't walk in them. I can't wear them. They fall right off. I have to return them.",1
"Loved the look of these sandals, but the elastic on the sides was so loose that I couldn't keep them on my feet. I returned them.",1
"I fell in LOVE with these sandals in the store and couldn't wait to wear them out. Unfortunately, they HURT LIKE HECK. The sole is too heavy for the straps, there's no flex or support AT ALL so it makes you walk like Frankenstein's Monster. The cheap material on the straps rubbed blisters within minutes, and after three wears, the footbed started falling apart. The faux-suede lining came unglued from the \",1
"I purchased these on a Thursday evening. They felt comfy and I thought they were super cute. I wore them to work (which is a sit down/desk job) the next day for casual Friday. They looked cute, but they kept digging into the top of my feet :( I look like someone cut my feet with a knife! Very deep cuts & my feet still feel sore/bruised/sensitive where they cut me (It's been 6 days) not to mention the horrible scabs :( Plus they were very heavy to walk in. So you have to make sure the straps are on correctly to avoid your feet/ankles from hurting more due to gripping the sandals. Very cute, but the straps need improvement! Maybe the straps closest to your ankles should be a little more forward?",1
"They are so comfy when you try them on. I wore them to work (I sit the majority of the day. Very minimal walking involved) and my feet are literally sore on the top & have cuts from the straps closest to my ankles. If you tighten the straps more they'll dig into your skin more. But if they're too loose you can't walk in them since they're a little heavy. Super cute. But not meant for wearing :(",1
"I felt in love with this shoes at the store and they were on clearance, so it was event better. The first day I wore them in less that 30 mins I felt something was bothering me when I saw my feet they were huge blisters in them. The next day I couldn't walk well. I don't recommend this sandals! Wish I have read the other reviews first.",1
"This sandal is the cutest slide on platform shoe that I have ever owned BUT take caution to the reviews because they are true lol. It doesn't take long/ much wear for this shoe to cut into your feet:(",1
"Horrible shoe. They are incredibly tight even though the sole fits perfectly. Like seriously, it was putting my big toe to sleep because the thong part between my toes was pulled to tight.",1

"I'm a true sz 7.5 and bought the sz 7, they fit good and comfortable. However, the first day I wore them to school, I walked through the halls and I hear this rubber screeching sound! Sound like old stale rubber duckies or old sneakers. I returned them that day I heard them. It's a shame I really wanted to love these.",1
"The sandal is awesome. I wish it was comfortable so I could keep it. The back rides up too high, the zipper detail rubs weird on your ankle. No way could I wear these more than 5 minutes. BUMMER.",1
"SO CUTE. But had to return them becuase the zipper cut my foot and made me bleed. :(",1

"So disappointed. I usually go with pricier sandals but I guess you do get what you pay for. There is no arch with this shoe at all. Wearing them is like walking barefoot on hard cement all day long. I've put them in the donation box already.",1

"These seemed to be exactly the platform style and comfort I was in the market for at a fantastic price point. Unfortunately the sandals came apart the second time I wore them in the city. I thought they made perfect city shoes but boy was I wrong. The strap completely separated from the platform leaving me with a flip flop and a weird ankle bracelet to walk-home in. Terrible quality. Things at Target used to be better, something is really off.",1
"Bought them online and they are super cute in person. But I wore them to walk my kid to school, down to the end of the block and back, and by the time I got home they had dug into my heels and I had bled all over them. Very disappointed.",1
"Not cushion-y. Not good",1
"I bought a pair of these shoes and the pearl part was coming off. I bought another pair and they had the same issue, as well as had stains on the bottom part towards the tip, so my foot doesn't cover it. These are supposed to be for a wedding and other bridesmaids had the same issue.",1
"The size is huge and most women will not be able to fit in it and so ur clearance is obvious as to why. The jolly green or purple or orange with yellow dots just wont be by Target to buy it for his jolly huge foot wife.",1
"Just what I wanted but washed them they shedded all over my clothes even on gentle and cold. Put them in dryer alone and had to empty the lint numerous times. Washed again, dried again, same thing. Even a 3rd time and the lint keeps coming. Need to return them this week!",1
"These are super soft directly from the store. If they never got washed - I would have probably given them 5 stars! But after the first wash - they shed insanely crazy - the entire thing came apart! It was horrible...returned right to store.",1

"Back it goes. I am normally a 36C. Now at 33 weeks pregnant, I am a 36D. I purchased this bra in a 36D/DD/E, and it while the cups fit snugly, I don't believe they'll give if I expand to a DD or E. Also, the part that wraps around and snaps is at least 2 inches too short. The sizing is WAY off for this bra.",1
"I wish I would have bought a band size bigger. I am a 38DDD, its tight around my ribs, digs in a little. I wish i would have tried to order a 40DDD for a little extra room.",1
"I bother these bras and for the first time I genuinely was not satisfied. They had a scratchy cloth and I could feel it grabbing my shirts everyone I wore them. Not comfortable. I had already washed them so I ended up throwing them away.",1

"I have a small chest. Im a 34A and this bra gives the WORST shape ever. I think MAYBE if i would have bought a size bigger it may looked a little better? but this was terrible. LAME",1
"This adhesive bra was a little heavy and pulled down on my chest. It also gave me a really, really funky shape. It was unwearable and I ended up tossing it. I would recommend going with a lighter/less heavy style. I've had other good items from this brand ... but this was disappointing.",1
"my daughter had bought this for her homecoming dress and it did nothing for her. Gravity won this battle. You must be smaller to wear  this bra, she is a 38 C and its WAY too small",1
"I had the worst experience with this bra. I had purchased it to wear with a backless romper and the largest size it comes In I believe is a size C. I am a size D but thought I would give it a chance. The first hour it worked properly but after that it kept falling off! I kept having to hold on to the bra. Gravity completely took over. If you are a smaller cup size this might be the bra for you but unfortunately for me never again.",1
"Wished this work for me, because the concept is awesom, but there is just no helping gravity.  Back straps are needed to help suppport better and lift.",1
"I returned this item. The fit was not good. The underarm design is poor, very little room to move your arms, tight fit under arms",1
"I bought the bras about a couple of weeks ago and they did not fit my mother and I . Was kinda disappointed.",1
"I ordered this bra in my size and it was too small. I was very disappointed. I wanted a wire free bra. I guess I will just stick to what I know. It's a nice bra but it does not fit me. They actually run smaller than the size.",1
"There are three main reasons I cannot recommend this bra. First is that it runs small both in the cup and band which makes it very uncomfortable. The other reasons are problems with the straps. They slip at the adjustment point in the back because of the slippery material of the non-stretch straps. To either side of the gel cushion, the 'strap' is narrow fabric that folds onto itself and cuts into the front of your shoulder.\n\nContradictory to the product description--\",1
"bra was way to tight even though i ordered a bigger size",1
"Bras were very skimpy and felt much too small. I need more substantial support so I returned these bras and purchased a brand that I usually buy.",1
"This bra was very disappointing. The cups are small and caused me to feel very uncomfortable, not knowing if I was going to drop through the bottom. Purchased Playtex along with this because I was not sure of the fit. Wise move on my part. Will NEVER purchase JMS bra again.",1
"I will never buy this bra again, waist of money. Might as well wear a thick t shirt under clothes for coverage",1
"even sizing up, the band was too small, so back it went",1
"I was surprised that the bra was about 2 sizes small. It was supposed to be a 38 but was probably a small 36. The cup size seemed correct but I had to return the item. I could not even try it on. The label inside the bra said 38DD but that certainly was not accurate.",1
"I purchased 4 of these bras and was thoroughly disappointed. They are not great bras for support. I am a 36 G and wearing these bras is like being bra less. Will return the 3 unworn",1

"Nothing in the description warns you of this being a minimizer bra but make no mistake about it, it DEFINITELY is a minimizer. I was NOT looking for minimizer. It only has the elastic around the outside of the cups so breasts look very strangely pointy but rounded at the tips. Very pretty bra and mostly comfortable, but not a good look. I wish I could return it but I washed it, learned the hard way.",1
"Although this bra looks pretty, it is very uncomfortable. The lace is not soft. It scratches the breast and around the torso. When it is on, it makes the breasts look pointy. Almost ackward looking. The bra fits snug. If you decide to purchase this item, do not buy the same size that you do in other Bali Bras. Go one size up. I wish I could send it back, but I washed it before trying it on. Try it on and make sure you like it before you wash it.",1
"I stay away from underwires as they are uncomfortable. They are even more so when the bra runs small. This bra runs small, the cups are narrow and the undewire was so uncomfortable that I put it on and took it right off. And I purchased a size larger than my previous bras. Goodwill for this one.",1

"I had to return this bra. Comfortable enough but even though I ordered my usual size, the bra caused me to buldge out over the top.",1
"I bought 6 of these because I could no longer get style 25790. I wear 42b. I bought 42b. It fit like a 38A. If you buy this bra you need to get a larger size. I am returning my order.",1
"The problem that I had with the bra was that the color faded onto shirt and ruined it.",1
"I had reconstructive surgery, purchased 3 of the Bali bras to wear after. I started wearing them 4 weeks after, I have now been wear them for about 4 weeks and this one is falling apart. The little elastic is coming out, the seams are coming loose, and this is only after 4 weeks. The other 2 aren't as bad I just don't wear them as much, this one this the most comfortable, and I pull on it , ALWAYS!!!",1
"I wear a 38 D and this bra is HORRIBLE. It offers no support I might as well not even be wearing it. The band rides up and ends up underneath my breasts and the cups offer no support, so my breasts just kind of hang there. I would not recommend this bra to anyone who does not have a tiny chest. Blah!!!",1
"There is no band. Its too loose. too much padding in cup. very pretty, would be good training bra. no better than a t-shirt.",1
"This bra is not what I want in a wirefree bra. It is big and bulky and thick. The description boasts of \",1
"I am just about to return all 4 that I have received. The first one I tried on felt comfortable at home, by the end of the day the padding in the cup was denting in all over. I wear a 40B. The worst part was after washing wearing again the cup rolled over the band that's underneath thus causing the band to roll up, felt like I was being strangled. The only good thing about this bra is the u-shape. I thought I finally found a bra, guess not.",1
"you can make a camping tent out of it, i hate it, just because a women is full breasted doesnt mean you have to make their bras look like hot air ballons",1
"The straps are non adjustable, and the bust # runs very small (yet the cups are large).",1
"The fabric was like as stiff as new denim. The fit was weird. Not at all happy with either product. Sent them both back for a refund.",1
"I bought three different bras. I ordered the same size I currently wear. All were way too small.",1
"Every Bra I buy is the same size in every manufacturer.\nThis bra is totally Incorrect in the Sizing. It is WAY too large.\nPlaytex ought to do better thn this???",1
"This runs large and loose in the cups (if you can call them cups) like one big blob that gave me a uni-boob. Sent it back. Also rolled up at the band probably from being not much support. Boobs didn't go where they should be.",1
"If you have this bra and think it's supporting you, you just haven't actually had a good bra. \",1
"I'm fairly large up top (44DDD) so finding any good bra is difficult in itself.. I thought (and prayed!) this bra would work, but no. It runs very small. No support! Not worth the purchase, no matter the price.",1
"Fit was okay, but there was no support. Would not recommend.",1
"So sorry I ever bought these bras. They are pretty but will never get worn. The over layer is sewn tighter in the V neck line of the cups, so that when you wear it, it makes a dented V line on the inside portion of the cups that is very visible through your shirt. Plus it is so so very itchy, and I am not a particularly sensitive person in general to fabrics and stitching. If it did not cost so much in shipping, I would have sent them back.",1
"I bought this pretty bra but it was way too tight for comfort, no give room at all.",1
"I bought a 38DDD however when it arrived the cup size was way too small. I gave it to my mom who is a 40DD and it fit her perfectly. I am not sure if the labeling on the bra was wrong or it's just a small fitting bra but it was a waste of money.",1
"I bought this and still waiting for the other two that were in the same order.\nI don't like when articles of clothing are made in other countries because they always seem to be made smaller for some reason. I'm waiting for the other two items to arrive and I'll return them all at once. I bought pone of these a couple years ago when I was in the store and tried it on, it fit then and still fits now, but not this one. Oh well ....",1
"This bra is uncomfortable and the fit is odd . It makes my chest look like it is shaped odd.",1
"Price was right, but it didn't fit. Also took forever to arrive. Second bra I ordered is back ordered for another month. I cancelled that one.",1
"I bought this bra for to wear to a formal dinner. I ordered the size indicated on the chart. The cup size was way too small and the straps were way too short. I returned it.",1
"The moment I saw the bra I knew it wouldn't fit. There area that holds your breasts was way too big. I ended up having to give the bra away as a gift. Very disappointed. I will not be buying anything else from here.",1
"This is the most uncomfortable bra I have ever worn. It was the correct size. The fit was fine. The material was so scratchy. The closure kept digging into my back whenever I moved,. Felt like there was splinter or something stuck in the material. Nothing there when I checked. The lace on the front scratchy as well. I tried washing the bra by hand, hoping that would remove the sizing or whatever made it so scratchy. Nothing. The first and only time I wore it, I looked like I was wearing a red bra when I took it off. I ended up throwing this away out of frustration. Expensive experience. Oh yeah, I did try it on in the store before I bought it online. But you can't wear it for an hour to find out if it will do this. My advice, stay away from this bra. If I could give it minus stars, I would.",1
"I did not get the bra that I ordered in the past. It did not fit as well and it was not made as well. I sent it back",1
"I have returned this item as it does not fit properly - it is beautiful but not a good fit",1
"This use to be a great bra. Now with the change in the \",1
"The wire always breaks thru in the front of the bra. I have 10-12 bras so it's not because they're used every day.",1
"Bought this bra in 44B. Band felt large. I was swimming in the cups. These were clearly NOT B cups. I checked the size tag and it was 44B but the cups were clearly Ds. The cups were molded so they held up but doubt that would last beyond a few wearings, and besides they made me look huge and all my coworkers would undoubtedly think I'd stuffed my bra.",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail). But the bandeau/wrap style doesn't work for large breasts. It just squashes them down with no support and you feel them pushed up against your body at the bottom of the bra. Just wearing it temporarily to pump was uncomfortable without any form of support. Same review for the Medela Easy Expressions Bustier. I'll be trying a DIY sports bra next...",1
"I bought 2 of these but have returned both. Unexpected padding, I should have read the reviews better. Still looking.",1

Padding defeats the purpose of a T shirt bra which I would expect to be cool, light, and comfortable.",1

"I bought this bra and 2 others by Maidenform, and none of them fit right or were comfortable. The cups were not positioned in front but more around under the arms, which made the bra rub my arms every time I moved. I sent them all back and will never try another bra by Maidenform.",1

If I'd tried it on within the allotted time I would have returned it for a refund. But I mistakenly assumed that it was going to be just like the others, boy was I wrong. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",1
"L/XL was so tiny - I'm like 36D and it was so tiny",1
"Just no support and uncomfortable. disappointed",1
"I have worn this bra twice, and it is the WORST bra I have ever worn. The straps fall down continuously, the underwire digs into your chest and the size isn't really the size. I have worn the same size for ever and this bra is one size smaller than it should be. DON'T BUY!!!!",1
"The shape of this bra is awful, it does not look anything like the picture.",1
"I wore this bra for several years in a 48B. Then I could no longer find in a 48B so started ordering 46C; not quite as comfortable but still ok. Now I see that JMS no longer carries even that size. Not sure if problem with Playtex or JMS but seems ridiculous that these bras are unavailable when customers obviously still want to buy them! Please see what your buyer can do, JMS.",1
"Both I and my sister in law tried this bra. If you want your bra to make you look like cones, this is your bra! Very weird shaped cups...",1
"i read the reviews and for the most part people were kind of happy with the bra so i bought 2 and they are both going back the cup is not the right size and the back is too small i have been wearing the same size bra for about 8 years and this one is not sized right",1
"These smelled even through the packaging. I washed them twice but the stench is still so bad and strong I wouldn't be able to wear them. I can't even in good conscious donate them. Pure waste of money!",1
"According to the sizing chart, I should have ordered a medium. I ordered a large instead, and it was still too small. If it wouldn't have cost so much to send them back, I definitely would have.",1
"Too flimsy, has no support, really not suited for women with larger breast.",1
"Offers no shape and very little coverage, meaning nipple show-through. The model's picture must be air-brushed over the nipple area. This is basically a cheap tube of elastic with the edges trimmed back to form the straps. I can imagine this bra would roll down if worn with the straps tucked in. I am very disappointed.",1
"I bought two t-shirt bras and the cups are too small. My breasts are falling out of the cups. I know what my bra size is because I just got measured a few weeks ago. I needed a basic black bra but I am very disappointed.",1
"I bought two bras I sent one back now I'm wishing I would have sent them both back not very happy at all sizing seems to be small in my opinion but I did buy some panties and I love those",1
"Hate, hate, hate this bra! The cups are so far apart, my boobs fall out when I bend over!",1
"Didn't fit well at all and I'll be returning it. I was fitted, and ordered that size, but nothing about this bra was right.",1
"I bought this because I have had good luck with Maidenform bras in the past. It's difficult to find the right fit for someone with narrow shoulders and large breasts. This bra looked great... until you put it on. If you're after a 50's era, conical, bra this is for you. If you're not into looking like you're smuggling traffic cones, steer clear!",1
"I could tell from the second I opened the package that this bra wasn't going to work. I've ordered my size, 34C, in many different brands and styles and have never seen one this small. It looked like it was maybe at most a B cup. I tried it on and sure enough it barely covered. To say these bras run small is an understatement! I've already sent them back and will not purchase in the future.",1
"I own what I thought was the same bra, I looked it up by the number and everything, but when I got the bra a ordered, simply in a cup size larger it was not at all what I expected. The material is extremely cheap. The bra band does not measure 32\",1
"I ordered my usual size and the cup size was perfect but the band size was ridiculously small. I held it up next to another bra of the same band size and it was several inches shorter. Don't know why they can't have normal band sizes.",1
"I didn't like this bra at all, was tempted to return it.",1
"Considering the name of this bra, it is so ironic how badly it fits. It definitely runs small! Buyer beware!",1
"One of my ladies is somewhere between a half and whole size larger than the other. This bra was not happening for me.",1
"dont work for size large chested people.",1
"I saw great reviews online for this and though it would be great because I was going to be an bridesmaid in my sister wedding. I went to Target and brought it. I am a 36 C and got a \",1
"Probably the worst bra I have ever owned. The bra does not stick at all. I followed the directions of showering and having a clean area to stick it on and it would not stick. Do not buy this bra.",1
"I was very disappointed with this unsupportive, uni-boob bra. I bought it two weeks before my due date and currently wear a 40G. This bra is not suitable for me at this size, much less after I start nursing and expect to need a larger size. I had to return it in store and order from an expensive, specialty bra store.",1
"Why does Target never have 34D? I used to buy my bras from Target all the time, but the last two years? Nothing.",1
"I bought this a few weeks ago and thought it was ok even though it was really itchy where the straps were connected at the back. However, as I was putting it on the other day the right strap broke where it should have connected at the front. It must have barely been sown on since it did not take much for it to come loose. Very disappointed...",1
"I just received this bra in the mail yesterday...and it's got the worst support of any bra I have ever worn.They should not be selling this bra in a size C, or maybe my boobs are just shaped weird. They slipped out any time that I moved. If I reached for something or bent over, or just walked around, my boobs would start bulging at the front of the cups until I finally would have to stuff myself back into it. And even if they didn't actually fall out, they'd fall together in the middle of the bra and make me look like a bra stuffer.\nDefinitely doesn't seem to be made for women with larger chests.\nI will be returning it.",1
"Bought these recently, they were not right for me, so returned them.",1

"I should have returned the bra right away because the clasp was so hard to close. It came apart after only having worn the bra three times. I would never recommend it to anyone.",1

Even worse, the cups had a cone shape instead of rounded. Maybe I'm the weird one here, but I do not have cones on my chest! I returned immediately.",1
"I purchased two of these bras and have only worn one of them. They are very poorly made and I want my money back",1
"Very uncomfortable -- hard and not flexible. No wonder it is called a minimizer; it restricts the breast shape. Additionally, there are five ( 5 ) closures in the back -- overkill. Wish I could return this bra.",1
"The fabric was scratchy, irritating, rough on the skin and too small.",1
"i found this was not easy to use and still needed help. i had a stroke and was note able to use the front closure feature",1
"Wires too high and long, digging into the armpits.",1
"Did not fit per sizing chart not comfortable at all need softer material",1
"Very unhappy, I think it was sized wrong and not at all typical of a Bali bra",1
"Very disappointed in this bra. Ordered my regular size but it was so small I cdnt close it at all. Had to send it back. Be ware.",1
"Don't like it at all very uncomfortable I feel like I wasted my money",1
"I bought this and returned it. I'm currently waiting on an exchange. I've been wearing this same satin tracings minimizer type bra for 33 years and never gotten a defective cut until now. It was quite distorted in its fit, and my weight as an adult has always been the same. I'm sure i just got an oddball. God bless.",1
"Can I return it? This was not the fit I was hoping for.",1
"I have worn this style for many years and it was always soft and comfortable. Now it is very rough and chafes the skin under my arms. Not sure why workmanship has gone down so much. Wish it were made in the USA too.",1
"It was Not true to size. I was not happy about it at all.",1
"I'm very disappointed in the quality of the bra. It was once a good product, but its gone downhill. Down waste the money.",1
"The d cup was like a double D. Very disappointed at the sizing. Won't buy Bali again",1
"There is no adjustment for the straps to make them longer, so I have to hike the bra up my back and pull it down in the front. Even at that, it rides up in the front and drives me crazy. I am constantly have to pull it down in front.",1

"The seams made the bras fit like the \",1
"Bought and I first few hours fit great. As day went on was smashed in front. No airflow between breast ugh! Thee them in trash!",1
"Won't be buying this one again. The wires would not lay flat in the v of the bar.",1
"I couldn't fit into the bras and i ordered them bigger than the size of my bras I have at home. The straps are also uncomfortable. I wont be ordering nor will i be recommending them.",1
"I don't know why a bra size isn't constant. I ordered this one in my regular size and the band was so small, I couldn't even try it on to see if the rest of it fit. Ordered another type in another brand and it was too big! Make sure you know how this one fits if you order it!",1
"I ordered two of these bali satin tracings underwire minimizer bras. I have worn this brand for years and have really liked them. I found these two new bras to be scratchy - it seems to me to be a lower quality material than the bras I have gotten before. I'm not real happy with these - but, kept them and wear them for short periods of time as they are uncomfortable. Where I live there are no stores to shop so will wait til I get to a town with some shopping malls to replace them with something else.",1
"Too bad they changed this bra to have only 3 hooks. My old ones have 4, and they are deeper in the center. The new ones are cut differently - they are lower in the front. I used to like this bra because it offered good coverage - and came up far enough in the center front so I didn't feel like I was hanging out on top.\nAlso, the last few times I bought this bra, after a couple washings, there was some kind of material between the layers of the cups that bunched up and formed a lump that was quite noticeable through even a conservative top. I used to like the bra so well the I would just make a small slit in the lining and get those lumps out. It didn't seem to matter that I just left the small slit there then.\nNow, with the changes that were made to the bra, I don't know if I even like it enough to go through the trouble.",1
"Underwire not strong enough wouldn't recommend this bra",1
"I was very dissapointed. Usually Bali bras fit me great. This bra had shoulder straps so short I couldn't get it on! I had to cut them and sew in a piece to lengthen them.",1
"This is a lovely bra, if it fits. I ordered 2, 1 in black which I couldn't even hook despite the fact that it was my usual size. The other was a lovely blush color and I did manage to hook it but I couldn't stand having it on for more than 1/2 hour. It is as uncomfortable as it is lovely. I must admit that I am not a fan of underwire bras in the first place, but this was just very uncomfortable.",1
"I'm sending both of these bra's back (black & rose). The seams in the middle of the cups is rigid -- a very unflattering fit due to the unsmoothness of the cup construction.",1

I was so dissappointed and because I have worn this bra for years I had already taken off all the tags and felt like I couldn't then return them. What they changed I cannot exactly pinpoint but I will not be getting it again. The pink and blue color fit differently then the black tan and white. Go figure!!!",1
"I have tried this bra in a couple sizes but it never fits correctly or lays flat. It is so uncomfortable after an hour I was miserable.",1
"I was very (unpleasantly) surprised by the fit of this bra. The cup size was okay, 36C, but the material on the straps and back of this bra is scratchy and uncomfortable!

"This is the single most uncomfortable bra I have ever purchased. I get poke in the underarm area by the \",1
"I ordered the same size as I usually would, but this bra was very tight. I usually keep my bras on the tightest hooks, but this bra barely fit on the loosest hooks. Even worse, the cups had a cone shape instead of rounded. Maybe I'm the weird one here, but I do not have cones on my chest! I returned immediately.",1
"I purchased two of these bras and have only worn one of them. They are very poorly made and I want my money back",1
"Very uncomfortable -- hard and not flexible. No wonder it is called a minimizer; it restricts the breast shape. Additionally, there are five ( 5 ) closures in the back -- overkill. Wish I could return this bra.",1
"The fabric was scratchy, irritating, rough on the skin and too small.",1
"i found this was not easy to use and still needed help. i had a stroke and was note able to use the front closure feature",1
"Wires too high and long, digging into the armpits.",1
"Did not fit per sizing chart not comfortable at all need softer material",1
"Very unhappy, I think it was sized wrong and not at all typical of a Bali bra",1
"Very disappointed in this bra. Ordered my regular size but it was so small I cdnt close it at all. Had to send it back. Be ware.",1
"Don't like it at all very uncomfortable I feel like I wasted my money",1
"I bought this and returned it. I'm currently waiting on an exchange. I've been wearing this same satin tracings minimizer type bra for 33 years and never gotten a defective cut until now. It was quite distorted in its fit, and my weight as an adult has always been the same. I'm sure i just got an oddball. God bless.",1
"Can I return it? This was not the fit I was hoping for.",1
"I have worn this style for many years and it was always soft and comfortable. Now it is very rough and chafes the skin under my arms. Not sure why workmanship has gone down so much. Wish it were made in the USA too.",1
"It was Not true to size. I was not happy about it at all.",1
"I'm very disappointed in the quality of the bra. It was once a good product, but its gone downhill. Down waste the money.",1
"The d cup was like a double D. Very disappointed at the sizing. Won't buy Bali again",1
"There is no adjustment for the straps to make them longer, so I have to hike the bra up my back and pull it down in the front. Even at that, it rides up in the front and drives me crazy. I am constantly have to pull it down in front.",1

"The seams made the bras fit like the \",1
"Bought and I first few hours fit great. As day went on was smashed in front. No airflow between breast ugh! Thee them in trash!",1
"Won't be buying this one again. The wires would not lay flat in the v of the bar.",1
"I couldn't fit into the bras and i ordered them bigger than the size of my bras I have at home. The straps are also uncomfortable. I wont be ordering nor will i be recommending them.",1
"I don't know why a bra size isn't constant. I ordered this one in my regular size and the band was so small, I couldn't even try it on to see if the rest of it fit. Ordered another type in another brand and it was too big! Make sure you know how this one fits if you order it!",1
"I ordered two of these bali satin tracings underwire minimizer bras. I have worn this brand for years and have really liked them. I found these two new bras to be scratchy - it seems to me to be a lower quality material than the bras I have gotten before. I'm not real happy with these - but, kept them and wear them for short periods of time as they are uncomfortable. Where I live there are no stores to shop so will wait til I get to a town with some shopping malls to replace them with something else.",1
"Too bad they changed this bra to have only 3 hooks. My old ones have 4, and they are deeper in the center. The new ones are cut differently - they are lower in the front. I used to like this bra because it offered good coverage - and came up far enough in the center front so I didn't feel like I was hanging out on top.\nAlso, the last few times I bought this bra, after a couple washings, there was some kind of material between the layers of the cups that bunched up and formed a lump that was quite noticeable through even a conservative top. I used to like the bra so well the I would just make a small slit in the lining and get those lumps out. It didn't seem to matter that I just left the small slit there then.\nNow, with the changes that were made to the bra, I don't know if I even like it enough to go through the trouble.",1
"Underwire not strong enough wouldn't recommend this bra",1
"I was very dissapointed. Usually Bali bras fit me great. This bra had shoulder straps so short I couldn't get it on! I had to cut them and sew in a piece to lengthen them.",1
"This is a lovely bra, if it fits. I ordered 2, 1 in black which I couldn't even hook despite the fact that it was my usual size. The other was a lovely blush color and I did manage to hook it but I couldn't stand having it on for more than 1/2 hour. It is as uncomfortable as it is lovely. I must admit that I am not a fan of underwire bras in the first place, but this was just very uncomfortable.",1
"I'm sending both of these bra's back (black & rose). The seams in the middle of the cups is rigid -- a very unflattering fit due to the unsmoothness of the cup construction.",1
"I was excited to find bras in my size (38G) so I ordered 3 of them. When they arrived I eagerly tried them on and was immediately disappointed. The fit was good but I was unhappy with the \",1
"Fell in love with this bra years ago & loved wearing it until this last order. There has definitely been a change (mfg resource?). Took over a month to get the two I ordered, fit was \",1
"It runs small...I ordered 4 others in same size...all fit really well, but this one is downright painful! It's SO thin too.",1
"I have purchased this bra maybe 25 times in the past and it has always been my favorite. Recently I ordered 4 more and I have no idea how or why they changed but the center seam on the cup has some extra material or SOMETHING along the seam that creates a weird bump, almost like an extra nipple. I was so dissappointed and because I have worn this bra for years I had already taken off all the tags and felt like I couldn't then return them. What they changed I cannot exactly pinpoint but I will not be getting it again. The pink and blue color fit differently then the black tan and white. Go figure!!!",1
"I have tried this bra in a couple sizes but it never fits correctly or lays flat. It is so uncomfortable after an hour I was miserable.",1

"Not impressed with the comfort, sizing or overall make of them.",1
"Looked cute in the photo....the reality is that it weights a ton is uncomfortable,looks nothing like the photo.....terrible and cheap",1
"The zipper on this product it of very low quality making it difficult to quickly put on and pump. I bought this so I could pump hands free but found the zipper to be very difficult to correctly zip which means it takes longer to use than if nothing was used (defeating the purpose of it.) It also does not hold the pumps tightly causing poor suction on the flanges and allows breast milk to leak from the bottom if you recline at all. This means I have to lean forward or hold the flanges in place (COMPLETELY defeating the purpose of the bandeau). Overall I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product and it is not what I would expect from Medela for the price paid.",1
"Not really hands-free",1
"I was new to pumping and looking for a hands-free bra. I looked at 2 Targets and they were out of the size I needed and ultimately ended up ordering this bra. I should have believed the reviews. It's aweful! Literally, the zipper broke on my first use. The holes are positioned oddly, at least for me anyways, and this could never have been intended for long term use. I finally got ahold of a Simple Wishes hands-free bra and continued living my pumping life without incident for the next 8 months. Please please please do not waste your valuable time as a new mom purchasing this...you'll just be returning it at some point.",1
"the zipper broke the first time I put it on, so I exchanged it the zipper broke on the next one the second time i used it, I returned it wished it would because it is really nice to have you hands free",1
"I really wanted this bra to work b/c my homemade cutouts in a regular bra weren't good (I had to get started right away before the bra arrived in the mail). But the bandeau/wrap style doesn't work for large breasts. It just squashes them down with no support and you feel them pushed up against your body at the bottom of the bra. Just wearing it temporarily to pump was uncomfortable without any form of support. Same review for the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier. I'll be trying a DIY sports bra next...",1
"The sizes run way too small and the zipper split when I was trying to get it off. It's not worth the money you pay for it.",1
"you need a bra like this but don't get this brand. the zipper broke on both of mine since they used such a cheap one. now i have a [brand name] bra that is much nicer and sturdier.",1
"I was obviously looking for something that would allow me to pump hands free and this is perfect! I am a size 34 D and I got the size medium! It fits perfectly, I have also washed and dried the bustier and it still fits perfectly! I will have to say the very first time I put it on I had a terrible time with the zipper, since the first initial wearing I had no further issues! I love this bustier!!! :)",1
"The very first time I tried this on the zipper broke. Complete waste of money. I should have listened to the other reviews on the poor quality zipper.",1
"There are much better options out there. This bra is much more work than it needs to be. Need to separate shields/flanges from pump to use bra. There are MUCH better bra options out there that allow you to skip the dismantling. Simple wishes hands-free bra is the way to go.",1
"Purchased this bra, since let's be honest, you absolutely need a hands free bra! Was so annoyed when the zipper broke after a week. Target was kind enough to replace it and well the second one's zipper broke as well! I just went out & recently purchased Lanisohn's hands free bra works well, wish I saved the $33 and did that to begin with!",1
"I have tried two sizes. Both were wrong. There is no way I am a Large. I have a small frame and fairly average size breasts. Any way, the zipper broke on each of the sizes I tried. This bustier was very poorly made.",1
"This is a waste of money. I had one and the zipper broke within a few days so I returned it and got another and now the zipper is broken on that one too. I have ended up cutting it's in a old sports bra.",1
"The zipper doesn't line up right, so it's a battle to zip it up. And then on top of that, the seam has ripped. I ended up buying the Lasinoh version and it is leaps and bounds better quality.",1
"I am very hard to fit because I am small framed, but generously endowed. Finally, I am happy. The cup are cut generously so I don't bulge over the top or sides. The sides are low enough they don't cut into flesh under my arms. The bra is smooth enough for under a T shirt, even with the girly lace. I am 65, but with this bra, my body looks like a teen-ager again.",1
"i bought this style of bra over a year ago. I have a hard time getting a bra to fit me right and this one does. When I look for them in the store I can never find two of the same color (white). So I decided to order them on line. This is even better I get them cheaper than in the store.",1
"I returned bra because stretch straps on that size bra don't work.",1
"I guess this bra is for larger size busts. No lining or pad at all so it doesn't make a nice shape or full look. I know I will never wear this but didn't return it because I do not want to spend any more money on this on shipping. In the pictures this bra looks like it has a nice support and coverage but actually the center parts that cover the breasts are just a thin, floppy material.",1
"I needed a 36 DDD bra & decided to try this one. The cup portion was not big enough",1
"This bra comes up too high in the middle. It pokes out very obviously. Wearing any tshirt or fitted shirt you will have the top of the middle section (the part between your breast) of the bra poking through your shirt. If you adjust the straps so it pulls that tight, then the sides of the bra sit right under your armpits while it jacks the back strap up to between your shoulder blades! Very unhappy with this bra!",1

"This is a comfortable, great-fitting and nice-looking bra- but I will never buy another one. The lace inserts on the front develop huge holes, making the bra unwearable when still fairly new. I bought a bunch of them because they seemed so good- and now I have to throw them all away. Don't waste your money--",1

So with that said, reading others reviews about going up a size I ordered the XL/1X, which I thought was a little big sounding. But did it because of the many reviews saying so. So I get them in the mail, try one on, and they are WAY to small!!! Now mind you, I am NOT an abnormally large person by any means. I'm fit and active and in perfect shape for a 30 year old. I'm 5'8\",1

It is also VERY hard to get on, it took me over 5 minutes to do so.  DO NOT LIKE THIS ITEM.\nTo send this review I had to put a star in COMFORT, it is far from comfortable!",1

"I'm currently 7 mos pregnant (38DDD pre-pregnancy) and my Target store didn't have the tried and true wireless that I was looking for in a 2X, so I gave Genie Bra a shot since they were 2 for 19.99.

He said I'd need more like a 5X...definitely no magic involved with this Genie Bra.",1

"After reading reviews I ordered size 2XL, it was equivalent to Champion's size Medium.",1

"Love the bra itself, however the straps are just awful. They are way too thin and just dig into my shoulders. I'd love to keep it but how can I wear something for several hours if not all day only to have it causing me pain? Unfortunately this bra will be on it's way back to JMS.",1

"If you have extra skin/fat/muscle around your shoulder blade region, this will not work for you. It hits right in the middle of it and fits terribly.",1
"Very bad design with the arm hole. The bottom of the bra is so high that it has rubbed and cut my armpit area. I will never wear this again. Do not buy. You will be sorry!",1
"Too small based on chart recommendations. order 1 size up from what they tell you.",1
"This bra curls us as soon as I tried to put it on, which made it virtually impossible to get on.",1
"Too thin. No support at the sides, so your breasts are flattened and distributed partially under your arms. I had a hard time getting it on and in place. It is so thin that the bra rolls up and you have to unroll it on your body. The front is not bad to unroll, but unrolling the back was hard. I bounced like I did not even have a bra on. If you need a bra to sleep in, this would be perfect.",1
"I purchased this bra after reading many good reviews, thinking this will be a nice bra, boy was I wrong to think that. There is absolutely no support what so ever, I wear a 36D, got the medium like it said, that was good, getting it on was very hard as it rolls up and very hard to pull down. After getting it on, I took one look in the mirror and took it right off, I guess if you are a very tiny size and don't need any support them you may like this bra. Need less to say it was shipped back the next day. Also the material is so thin, you may use it for sleeping in. I would not recommend this bra if you are big busted.",1
"I just got the bra today, tried it on and it was way too tight. I got the size recommended by your company. I am very disappointed and I hope I will have no problems sending it back and getting my money returned.",1
"In the picture you cannot see the models nipples, but you can sure see them when I wear it",1
"I've purchased many of these bras and much prefer the lighter-weight silky/nylon versions that you previously sold. For size mediums in this heavier fabric, they are way too tight and I feel like I can't breathe in them. I will have to take a scissor and cut some slits on the back side to make them more comfortable.",1
"In the description it did not say whether this was a halter, but in the questions portion it did say it was a halter, but unfortunately it was not a halter. I will be sending it back and will not order from this website again.",1
"I bought this bra in the exact size of another comfort flex bra and this one was uncomfortable and binding. No hooks as it is slip on but runs really small and has a very high back.",1
"I have always struggled with finding a bra to fit. I wear a 38-40a which cannot be found in a regular type bra. I usually wear a lg in a Bali crop top but followed the sizing for hanes and ordered a med. The band and cup fit perfectly but the arm pits cut in so much I could not wear it. I did not order the large because the coverage of material did not seem likely that it would work well and paying more shipping makes it unreasonable to try the next size up. Would probably work well for those in the center of the size range.",1
"Seamless bras were VERY snug for their size; And completely sheer! So could be easily seen through. If one wears a white or light colored cotton shirt with these bras, your lady parts could be easily seen through in sunlight. Not a good product.",1
"I'm very slim and wear a 34A. The size chart indicates that I should purchase a Small in this bra; in fact, it indicates I could be several sizes larger and still wear a small. But the size Small I received was so ridiculously tight, it seems I would have to order a Large, which is way out of line with every other item I have ever purchased.\n\nThese bras are tight, uncomfortable and shapeless and compress you flat like a girdle. I can't imagine anyone wanting to wear one.",1
"I use these for sleeping and the first time I ordered them they were great but this order was different. I ordered XL as I'm a 38-D and the band around my chest was way too tight, this was surprising being that I was completely in range and not on the borderline to XXL. They get you with the return shipping being so high that it's not even worth returning.",1
"I bought these bra's 3 weeks ago in XL. I weigh 130 lbs and wear a b cup bra. These bra's were so small and so tight I could not wear them. They have been returned. They are definitely not true to size.",1
"Cup size is very wrong they are too small but other then that a very comfortable bra.",1
"I've brought the same bra in the store with no problem. I ordered 4 online and all 4 squeak! It's awful! Any movement at all and there is an awful squeaky noise. So embarrassing. I don't know what they changed with the materials but do not buy this bra!!!! I wish someone would have warned me.",1

"I have been purchasing these bras for many years. They are comfortable and fit well. Unfortunately, over the past few years the quality has been going down. After some time the seam in the cup seams begins to come unraveled. It's usually minor and can be easily repaired (though it is irritating to have to do so). With my last purchase this issue was the worst. I wore the bra 1 (ONE) time and the entire seam split after I removed it for the day. This was a comfortable, correctly sized item. Needs some serious quality control!",1
"I bought this bra because it's hard to find bras in my size. This bra looks pretty, but it has no support and the fit is awful. I assume I'd have to try several on to find the right fit. I'd send it back but it's too much of a hassle.",1
"Tried this model for the first time. So glad I only bought one. It is flimsy and offers no support to a well endowed form. The straps cut IF they even stay on the shoulders.",1
"I was so happy to see a plus size bra in a color other than white or beige. Tried on immediately after opening and so disappointed. Not true to size...band size was much too tight. Fabric was stiff and scratchy on my skin. Cups made me look conical like back in the era of Madonna's popularity. Returned ASAP for refund.",1
"i only had this bra for a month and it started to come unsewn underneath. the satin stretches out to much like it wears out fast. I would recommend this bra to no one!!!!!!!!",1
"I really goofed with this selection. Cups fit but that's about it. The straps are so short they pull the bra up into my armpits. I wore it like that anyway and at the end of the day (about 10 hours later), the band (which was not tight) had cut into my skin and stuck, hurting me when I removed it. Additionally, this bra offers NO side support, so if you have side migrating boobs, don't expect to get them in front of you with this bra.",1

Additionally, this bra offers NO side support, so if you have side migrating boobs, don't expect to get them in front of you with this bra.",1
"I wore this to work and everyone stared at my chest because my breasts were pointed funny. Also the band constantly flips up and is very uncomfortable. Into the trash for this one!",1
"I returned this bra. I did not like it. It did not provide support",1
"not what I expected. did not like the sagging of the breasts",1
"No support, horrible bra!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"I bought four of these bras, thinking they would be a big improvement over the wired ones I've been wearing. They are well made and comfortable but they give no support and don't stay in place.",1
"Needs more padding. Can see nipples through bra.\nVery discouraging.",1
"Very disappointed in Bali bras. Most of their styles exclude certain sizes, such as 42B.",1
"I bought two hoping for decent support, but was very disappointed. As a 32D I ordered the small which fit fine, but almost total lack of support. I guess I will use them in the evening when I am home alone in my pajamas.",1
"I am very unhappy with this bra. I was satisfied with the fit and did not save my receipt or else it would have gone back, lesson learned. Now I torture myself each time I wear it hoping to just get my money out of it. The band around my chest rolls and is very uncomfortable.",1
"The shoulder straps roll up all the time making it uncomfortable.",1
"Although the description led me to believe this bra would offer sufficient support without the underwire, I found it to be useless for more than a comfortable bra to sleep in. It offers NO support for D cup sizes.",1
"The size chart was not correct the brain is to tight",1
"I bought 2 of these bras and both of the seams in the cups came apart.\nThis happened within the first month of wearing them. I thought they would last longer than a month.......",1
"Not a good fitting bra. Should have seen that coming as sizes are sm, med, and lg. Used sizing chart listed on web site, but bra was too large. Cups size was ok (36DD) but could not adjust straps which left them sagging and waste would not stay put (would roll up and under if I bent over to tie shoes or pick something up). At best a good couch potato bra.",1
"According to the sizing chart, the 2X should have fit me with room to spare. Obviously the smart bra didn't read the chart because it was seriously tight and uncomfortable. The band rolled up immediately and I had a back ache within minutes of putting it on. Very disappointing.",1
"What a disappointment! I should have returned it after I tried it on, but I made the mistake of washing it before and then wearing it and found out after that it is the most disappointing bra I have ever brought! It bunches up under the girls, and the straps don't stay put, they bunch up too, which in turn they start to dig into my shoulders. When I do where it, I might add only at home,I am always pulling it down because it rides up. The only thing I can say about it positively is it is very soft and comfortable, but with NO support what so ever. Big mistake and a waste of money!",1

"When I first purchased this bra I thought it was one of the best that I had worn to date. Unfortunately a year later I purchased several additional of the same style (checked numbers to confirm match) and found that Bali had reduced the amount of material for the bra. This means that there is less support from the back strap and less coverage/support from the cups. In addition, within the past two months I have had the plastic sizing guides on a strap for two bras snap....once while I was adjusting a strap and the other time when I was lifting an item out of my car.",1
"I have this Bali bra on now in a 38DD. It is my FAVORITE BRA EVER! When I ordered 3 more on this site, I received them (marked as item #3383 in 38DDD as previously purchased elsewhere) and ALL WERE AT LEAST 2 SIZES TOO BIG in the CUP + 1 size in the BAND?!? I am so disappointed and frustrated. Are these seconds/old stock? Has Bali changed their sizing? I am sad that there was no indication of ANY change of sizing on the site.

I thought this product would help alleviate the pain but unfortunately it was too big! I got a M/L since I am a size 12 pre-pregnancy, and currently wear a Large in pregnancy clothes. I haven't gained any weight except for my huge belly. When I put it on it did not feel much different than not having anything on. It also bunches up in the back making it very visible through my clothing. I will say however that the cold gel pack feels great and seems to make the belt fit a little better. I tried wearing it on top of my clothes and the fit was much better but I could only do that around the house. I also really like the material of the belly band. I'm hoping that as my belly grows the next few weeks it will fit better and I can utilize it comfortably.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",2
"I wasn't even sure how to wear this as it came with no directions. I'm pretty sure I had it on backwards, inside out, and upside down... which didn't matter because anyway I wore it, it wasn't working. I didn't feel much support from this. I was 8 months pregnant when I bought it and got a s/m based on other reviews, but it was tight on me (wish they had some sort of measurements so you know which one to buy). The pearls are nice and I used them separately for my back. I should have spent the extra money to buy a more supportive band that supports on top of my tummy as well.",2
"When I tried the band by itself my zipper kept going down. Then I placed the cloth that comes with the band (so your underwear wont show) and it just didn't look or feel right. It didn't feel secure.",2
"I was really excited about this product after reading the reviews. The fabric panel doesn't look good at all. As stated, your open zipper still shows, so it looks like you are walking around with your fly down and your underwear showing. With your belly, even with a long shirt, it shows. I thought it didn't until my husband said something. Very embarrassing, but he did take me to buy shorts that night. I think I used this for two weeks before that. I only used the short button one, even though I thought I would be using this all the time with all the different parts. Save your money and make your own, or just go get some real pants. (I made it through with 2 pair shorts, 1 capree jeans, 1 pair jeans, 1 pair sweats, & 2 pair dress pants.) [...]",2
"This item was good in the sense that it did hold my pants up but it also always looked like my pants were undone underneath my shirt. You could clearly see that there was something going on. I returned it and bought the BellyBe band and would recommend that product over this one any day. It's essentially a tube top of spandex that fits over your pants hip height but is tight enough that it holds your pants up and because it's tight fitted it presses the buttons down so it doesn't look like your pants are undone. Belly Belt wasn't bad but could be better.",2
"I was so excited to find these but was highly disappointed when I tried them. It didn't work for me at all. They made my pants too loose in the waist! My pants would sag and slip off so I couldn't even wear them out of the house. I should have returned them. Not sure if they would work better for high waisted pants but I wear lower waisted pants. I would not recommend these. Try the belly bands instead.",2

"Bought after having my 2nd baby (c-section). It's not bad. Seems to work well, but doesn't cover as much area as I thought. I used exactly as instructed to at first. But then creases developed where it kept folding up making it very uncomfortable. Even after washing/cleaning it, the creases remained & it continues to fold over in many areas. I no longer wear it as much due to same & having to constantly unfold it and adjust it. Bummed I spent that much money on it.",2

The shirt is incredibly soft and comfortable, but very unflattering. The photos of us getting ready show every crease and roll that a girl would rather not emphasize. The price was great and it would be great for just lounging around...",2
"I didn't like the synthetic fabric. Will return.",2
"Very cute top! It runs a bit large and is fairly see-through, but I prefer a looser fit and layered it over another tank. It looked great, until I washed it. The raw-edges unraveled a bit.

"I purchased these because my sister raved about them when she was pregnant. She said they were the most comfortable pants and wore them all the time. So I ran out and purchased a pair s/m while in my second trimester. They are definitely comfortable but they do not stay up. I had to continue to pull them up all the time because they would slip down....I wear a size 2/4 pre-pregnancy and they may just run too large...Unfortunately I am not a fan of these pants.",2

"This bra was comfortable but has no padding and there is a seam that runs vertically down the cups that bothered me. I couldnt feel in in the cup but you could see a big raised line even with an undershirt and shirt on top and that bugged me. I ended up returning it and getting something else.",2
"Wouldn't recommend these to a bigger woman (size 18 and up). I had these on no longer than a few hours and I had 2 runs going from the top of the pants down the back by the butt to the seam in the crotch. Was very disappointed as they are super comfy.",2
"i bought a s/m in my first trimester even though i was on the large size of medium before getting pregnant.  they look cute and are comfortable over all but they fall down ALL the time.  they did not stay up at any point in my pregnancy.  i guess they need some extra spandex or something....",2
"These leggings, while super comfortable, are not a good fit for any woman, let alone a pregnant one... I am normally a size small and I purchased both the small/medium and medium/large based on other reviews and even the medium/large was almost as see through as tights. Went back the same day they were delivered. No one wants to see what color underwear you are wearing. So if you aren't using these leggings as home lounge wear or under a VERY long top, please spare us.",2
"I read good reviews on these and they are comfy, but sheer and a little see through. I felt like my bum had to be completely covered. They didn't have my size in-store, so I wasn't able to try them on. Also, the crotch is kind of baggy.... I just wish I had spent a little more $$ and gotten better quality since I anticipate wearing them a lot.",2
"These are basically thick tights.  I'm returning them - they're too itchy to be comfortable.",2
"I was excited to find some leggings with a higher waistband since my favorite pair have been cutting right across my belly. These leggings are much thinner than the ones I usually wear and I agree that you do need a long top with them as they are a little sheer, kind of disappointing since it is December. The waistband has been staying up fine but it always feels like the crotch is falling down or too low. I find myself constantly pulling at the material in the thighs trying to get the crotch to sag less. For this reason I do not find them super comfortable.",2
"These leggings were not comfortable, and I'm only 4 months pregnant.  Can't even imagine wearing them as I get bigger.  My pre-pregnancy size is a 4.  I purchased these leggings in a small and they were too small- just too tight all over.",2
"When I first got these I loved them. They are thick pantyhose material, the only issue is when i bent overly they were slightly see through but sadly most leggings are and I generally wear things to cover most of my butt anyways. But mostly they were comfortable, stretchy with losing their shape, and have a little bit of suck-in factor. But it all went terribly wrong on day 3 when not only did they snag ever so lightly and get a HUGE run in the butt and all up my leg, and then the crotch got a massive 3 inch gaping hole. No thanks.",2
"I wore these one time and they started to pill right away between the thighs, and I have thin legs so it wasn't a situation where they were rubbing excessively. The fabric IS nice and thick but they look terrible with all of the pills on them.",2
"Not comfortable for skin, pill very easily and fall down very easily. Not match the price at all. Got Mossimo yoga pants which is much better with half price.",2
"I noticed right away that the fabric, while thick, tends to pill very easily.  Also, they fall down.  I have found other thick leggings or pencil pants that hold their shape much better.",2
"40DD/E here.  A pumping bustier is a must-have, but this one was very disappointing, as the zipper broke after I had used it only a few times.  I bought another brand (available on this website!) that was much sturdier and better fitting.  Get that one, not this one!",2
"I was so excited to start using the bustier, as I recently returned to work and really need to use my pumping time working and not just sitting here holding the pump!  Well, I was only able to use it TWICE.  Granted, those two uses were awesome, because I was able to multitask with ease...but the third time I put it on, the zipper busted and now it's completely useless...",2
"I was so excited about this bra the first time I used it. It was amazing to finally be able to pump and use my hands. Tonight was the second time I used it and the zipper broke. I plan to bring it back tomorrow. Beware.",2
"I've only had it 2 weeks and the zipper broke.  The sizing said I needed a small, but I chose a medium and am glad I did.  There's no way a small would have worked so the zipper didn't break because I was using one that was too small for me.  For the cost, it's not worth it!  I'm already looking for something else!",2
"for the amount that they charge for this item, they could afford to improve the zipper. it is VERY low quality and constantly pops and breaks which is very frustrating",2
"I bought 2 of these since I've been happy with the other Medela products. There is no option to add straps, & there is no \",2
"A bustier makes double pumping SO much easier and this is a great idea but the zipper on this one broke within the first two weeks. I have been working with it to keep it going but I would recommend going with another brand. It is not worth the money or the hassle.",2
"The ability to pump hands free is fantastic. However, this bra is very cheaply made and has made me more mad than satisfied. I had it less than a week when the zipper first broke. I've fixed the zipper numerous times since then. It should have a clasp or something to help hold it together while zipping. If there is a better alternative, take it.",2
"I loved it at first. It was great to be hands free. The zipper was hard to zip, it was hard holding the bra together and trying to zip. After only having it for 3 months the zipper broke. Would not recommend this product.",2
"I love this bra but my zipper broke after the first use. I can still rig it, but its very annoying. I'm a 38DD and have the XL which should fit just fine...but the zipper breaks every time I try to zip it up",2
"The zipper on this is one of the lowest quality I've ever had to deal with. It is constantly not working which completely defeats the purpose of the bra. I would say 80% of the time I've used this bra I've had issues with the zipper. Maybe total waste of money.",2
"This is an awesome concept & with the right product could prevent your world from pausing while you pump. The zipper broke the FIRST time I put it on (it's poor quality, definitely got the correct size). After using it for about 4 months, I still fight the zipper each time. It takes 10 tries sometimes before the zipper will engage and sometimes I just give up. The price is not right for something of poor quality. I will be attaching prong snaps to it this week.",2
"Love the fact that I can pump without hands but the zipper is terrible! It takes me almost as long to try to zip it up without the zipper splitting as it does to pump.",2
"Mine worked for 3 months but was a pain because the zipper always got stuck. It finally broke completely the other day, prompting me to write this review.",2
"So far I've bought two of these easy expressions bustier because they keep on breaking. The first one I bought had a faulty zipper that popped after around two months use. The second one has holes in the fabric after around two months use. The product is definitely not made with long term quality in mind.",2
"Cheapest zipper ever! I can't believe this is over $30 with a zipper that breaks almost every time I try to use it. I spend half my lunch break trying to get it on!",2
"So, I got this free with the purchase of a breastpump.\n\nThat was nice.\n\nThe not so nice - it doesn't fit.\n\nThe sizing chart says it should fit but not even close. I'm a 42C, so according to the sizing chart it should fit. Alas, it does not.\n\nI was skeptical about it fitting anyway but it would need another like 3 inches to fit. And Target doesn't even sell the larger size.\n\nOh well, I guess I'll be returning this too.",2
"I'm a small person (34C now that baby has arrived) but the sizing on this bustier is totally off. Though according to the chart on the back I could get a size S, the M I first purchased was too small to zip! I managed to cram myself into it once, but the second time I went to use it the zipper split. I returned it and got a size L, and even it seems slightly strained in the zipper. I would say if you are large-breasted this product is not going to work out very well for you.",2
"It was wonderful while it lasted. I haven't even had it a month before the zipper broke.",2
"Was not a 32 f/G, more like a dd, wish they had a bigger size because I am G. The no wire was nice but just didn't fit. I would only recommend if you are a smaller size so order one cups size up or two",2
"two stars because there was nothing actually defective with the bra and it came on time. however, this bra is extreamly pointy, almost bullet bra like. whos breasts are actually shaped like a cone? i had so much extra room between my skin and the point of the bra. id be embarrissed to wear this in front of anyone! it also runs big (maybe to help nursing moms out when they forget to account for growing breasts) its just a weird shape and support.",2
"Oh I really wanted to love this bra :-( when it arrived I thought it looked super supportive and was excited. But then when I wore it, the fit was awful! The band was too small, the cups too large, and there was all this extra material bunching on the sides. I tried adjusting straps and tweaking the fit but its no use. It put my boobs in such a weird position , smashed them together even though there was plenty of cup left on the sides which then just bunched up under my arms. It does have nice wide comfortable straps, but I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to the large busted (I am a 38 DDD or F)",2
"1. too much hassle to zip up and down\n2. Kind of difficult to insert the pumping accessories and take it out\n\nI only end up pumping 10-12 minutes, so did not find it worth to spend few minutes on this.",2
"It worked great when I first got it. I've been pumping for ten months, full time, and the zipper started popping out after seven months. I would have preferred one without a zipper that was solely a tube.",2
"I bought the belly band to help stay in my some of my pants longer and it did not work for me.  The Belly band is ok if you stay standing.  I am up and down all day for work and the band would just roll up and then feel fight and awkward.  The idea was nice but ended up wasting my money",2
"Wouldn't recommend these to a bigger woman (size 18 and up). I had these on no longer than a few hours and I had 2 runs going from the top of the pants down the back by the butt to the seam in the crotch. Was very disappointed as they are super comfy.",2
"i bought a s/m in my first trimester even though i was on the large size of medium before getting pregnant.  they look cute and are comfortable over all but they fall down ALL the time.  they did not stay up at any point in my pregnancy.  i guess they need some extra spandex or something....",2
"These leggings, while super comfortable, are not a good fit for any woman, let alone a pregnant one... I am normally a size small and I purchased both the small/medium and medium/large based on other reviews and even the medium/large was almost as see through as tights. Went back the same day they were delivered. No one wants to see what color underwear you are wearing. So if you aren't using these leggings as home lounge wear or under a VERY long top, please spare us.",2
"I read good reviews on these and they are comfy, but sheer and a little see through. I felt like my bum had to be completely covered. They didn't have my size in-store, so I wasn't able to try them on. Also, the crotch is kind of baggy.... I just wish I had spent a little more $$ and gotten better quality since I anticipate wearing them a lot.",2
"These are basically thick tights.  I'm returning them - they're too itchy to be comfortable.",2
"I was excited to find some leggings with a higher waistband since my favorite pair have been cutting right across my belly. These leggings are much thinner than the ones I usually wear and I agree that you do need a long top with them as they are a little sheer, kind of disappointing since it is December. The waistband has been staying up fine but it always feels like the crotch is falling down or too low. I find myself constantly pulling at the material in the thighs trying to get the crotch to sag less. For this reason I do not find them super comfortable.",2
"These leggings were not comfortable, and I'm only 4 months pregnant.  Can't even imagine wearing them as I get bigger.  My pre-pregnancy size is a 4.  I purchased these leggings in a small and they were too small- just too tight all over.",2
"When I first got these I loved them. They are thick pantyhose material, the only issue is when i bent overly they were slightly see through but sadly most leggings are and I generally wear things to cover most of my butt anyways. But mostly they were comfortable, stretchy with losing their shape, and have a little bit of suck-in factor. But it all went terribly wrong on day 3 when not only did they snag ever so lightly and get a HUGE run in the butt and all up my leg, and then the crotch got a massive 3 inch gaping hole. No thanks.",2

"Bought after having my 2nd baby (c-section). It's not bad. Seems to work well, but doesn't cover as much area as I thought. I used exactly as instructed to at first. But then creases developed where it kept folding up making it very uncomfortable. Even after washing/cleaning it, the creases remained & it continues to fold over in many areas. I no longer wear it as much due to same & having to constantly unfold it and adjust it. Bummed I spent that much money on it.",2

"Ill-fitting. Too long on me, and too loose around the ankles. Not at all flattering (I'm 5'4\",2
"As others have said, very comfortable. However, the clasps to open the front of the bra for nursing are not \",2
"Loved the design, fabric and ability to wear as racer back style. I was really disappointed that the sizing for this particular style was way off for me. I ordered an XL, and the band fit, but the cut of the bra did not match my breast size. The fabric did not cover the outer breast area, and it was too small. For the price, I was not satisfied, so I opted to return this item.",2
"I wore these one time and they started to pill right away between the thighs, and I have thin legs so it wasn't a situation where they were rubbing excessively. The fabric IS nice and thick but they look terrible with all of the pills on them.",2
"Not comfortable for skin, pill very easily and fall down very easily. Not match the price at all. Got Mossimo yoga pants which is much better with half price.",2
"I noticed right away that the fabric, while thick, tends to pill very easily.  Also, they fall down.  I have found other thick leggings or pencil pants that hold their shape much better.",2
"Cute dress and would have been a great buy for the price had the belt been sized the same as the dress. I got the XL, but the belt was sized more like a medium. I couldn't even get the two ends to meet at the top of my bump.",2
"The fit was okay but they were about 5 inches too long. only 1 inch shorter than the regular length.",2
"My boyfriend's usually a size 10. These are like clown shoes for him.",2
"I'm 5'4 just under 120lbs and ordered an xs online. It's cute enough but roomy for an extra small, here's hoping it shrinks some in the wash. A little darker than pictured, it has no back pockets which in combination with the oversize fit has an unflattering flattening effect.",2
"These jeans were just not a good fit. They fit like tapered leg jeans instead of skinny jeans. The fit was just weird.",2
"Although my little one loves these pants and says they are very comfortable, I'm not a fan. While purchasing jeans and jeggings, I am looking for a thicker material than leggings. These are very thin! I feel that some of my daughters leggings are thicker material than these.",2
"size runs a lil on the bigger end, fit was looser than I expected. Material was harder than I thought as jeggings are usually soft. design is as cute as depicted.",2
"I bought this shirt in a bunch of different sizes for my bridesmaids. I printed their names and titles on them and that turned out really cute. The shirt is incredibly soft and comfortable, but very unflattering. The photos of us getting ready show every crease and roll that a girl would rather not emphasize. The price was great and it would be great for just lounging around...",2
"I didn't like the synthetic fabric. Will return.",2
"Amazing that one shirt - black one is perfect and the 'sea fog heather' is 2 sizes smaller.",2
"It was a beautiful color and it fit well. However, you could completely see through the top. Had to return it.",2

"This sweater looked really cute online. It runs really large. Ordered according to my measurements and it is really quite big. Feels heavy which I guess is a good thing if you want warmth. Also had to look at label because it certainly does not feel like cotton. Thought it was polyester . Will keep as it was not expensive but really quite disappointed.",2
"Based on other reviews, I order a size smaller than I normally wear and it fit perfectly. The design is flattering and makes me look thinner and I like the material. I'm returning the dress because it does not have a liner. With the white parts, you can see where the material stops up toward the neckline and it makes it difficult to wear any undergarments that don't match your skin tone. If this dress were lined, I would keep it.",2
"The fabric of this dress is substantial and feels high quality. The construction is done well, however the fit of this dress is very odd. It's VERY short - I'm 5'5 and 135 lbs. I'm a small in most target dresses and that's what I ordered for this dress, and I suppose it was the correct size as it fit everywhere. However, it was SO short - unless you're shorter than I am, I would absolutely not consider this a work dress. The waist hits much higher than your natural waist (again, if you're a petite height this might work for you) and I agree with a previous reviewer that the way the skirt flares out is not flattering and adds a lot of bulk. I had high hopes for this dress but it was such a bomb.",2

"They were not flattering and the legs were ridiculously wide. I'm very short and that just doesn't work for me.",2
"These pants were oddly proportioned on me and the quality was inconsistent. The waist measurement was correct for me on the size 6, but the rise was too short so they wanted to ride up. Not cute and not comfortable. I tried an 8 (which was too big in the waist), but they still looked like they were riding up in the front (also not cute). And strangely, the thighs were tighter on the bigger size. The fabric was ok, but a little thin. They didn't seem like they would last very long.",2

"I thought these pants were decent - cute style, good fit, not the highest quality fabric but good enough - until I worked out with my husband and he told me the exact color and pattern of my underwear was completely noticeable when I bent over. They're now home workout pants.",2
"The leggings I received look like the picture, but they are so thin that my underwear lines can be clearly seen without even bending over! The only way I could wear these is to go commando, which I am not enthusiastic about. It's a pity but these are getting returned.",2
"I like the design on them, but once I put them on I realized the low quality of them. The rear is completely see-through once you put them on. It also looks very unflattering as it cuts weirdly into your skin instead of keeping everything tight and together like high-quality spandex pants do. They were fairly thin and not very stretchy, so I feared they'd rip immediately when doing any kind of workout. Wish I tried them on first; I will be returning.",2

"The print and style of this dress are really cute, but the fit was really unflattering. I am very petite and the dress made me look very frumpy. This may look better on curvier girls with more of a figure, I wouldn't recommend this to someone on the small side. The back is adorable though and I wish it were on another dress.",2

"I'm 5'8 and this dress was so short on me, it barely covered my bottom. I actually laughed out loud it was so crazy short.",2
"really baggy in top, way too tight in the hips, made for people with no hips, might be good for a little girl who is really tall....awesome flannel plaid, really wish it fit better",2
"I liked the fabric of this dress, but the drop waist hit me at a very weird place and the neckline was unflattering. Unfortunately I had to return it.",2
"Cute dress, great color, way to short",2

"I'm a pretty solid medium in most standard brands and sizes, but on these pants, the length was rather long on me (I'm 5'5\",2
"Looks cute in the picture. Very thin and feels so cheap, also runs small. This sweater is going to be returned.",2
"I absolutely love the look and style of this top but unfortunately the scallops just did not lay very nicely on my chest. The scallops are made of just one layer of very flimsy bathing suit material so they were kind of flopping around. I'm an A cup so maybe for a larger chest it would lay better? Unfortunately I'm taking this one back to the store.",2
"Definitely agree with others about sizing up. I am consistently a size small and these were just too tight in a size small (I am 5'5\",2
"I love the concept for this swimsuit and think the design is adorable, however, there is no darting in the top to make room for breasts. I can only see this being cute on girls with small chests (like size AA or maybe A cup). I'm a 32C and the top smushed my boobs down and made them appear very pancake-y with smashed side boob revealed. I really wanted to love it but my boyfriend agreed that it did nothing for my figure.",2
"I really loved the style of the suit and the picture online but the fit just wasn't right. The bottom is very narrowly cut which left more skin exposed that I wanted. The top is also so narrow that a wrong turn could have left me exposed. I'm 5'4 and around 125 lbs and bought a medium.",2
"This product is super cute and I love the ruffle details on the bottoms.\n\nHowever, I am a size 8/10 and thought that the large size would be big enough but they were extremely small on me. It was disappointing that the large were too small for a size 8/10 and I doubt the next size up would fit either because of how small the large were. Also, the ruffles would tuck/flap inside the suit and you could not see them unless you constantly pulled them out.\n\nI suggest this item for very petite women.",2
"The color is great, the quality is great, the fit is not...at least for me. I'm 5'1\",2
"Extremely cute suit, but unfortunately the fit is very odd. I ordered a size S (probably should have gotten an XS) and the top half was huge while the bottom half was very tight. I think it's made for people with large chests and small bottoms. Sadly I am the opposite. I really wish I could have made this work! I might order the XS just in case.",2
"I would 100% recommend this suit to a girl without a large bust, but if you have larger breasts, it probably won't work for you. There was barely any room at the top and I was worried about a possible wardrobe malfunction! This was so upsetting since the bottom half and back fit and looked awesome, but unfortunately, I will be returning :(",2
"I wear a 34A bra and the medium was WAY too small for me. I could barely fasten the lower hook and fastening the upper hook was impossible on my own. Once fastened it was entirely too tight. Not comfortable at all.",2
"Unfortunately, I didn't love this suit. The color and scalloped detail were beautiful, but the inside lining of the suit kept showing along the backside. And, I thought the plunge neckline was too revealing for my 34C size, although the top still gapped on the sides. The bottom was a bit small. For reference, I'm usually a size 6 with a long torso, wide hips, larger butt, and I got a Large.",2
"Very cute top! It runs a bit large and is fairly see-through, but I prefer a looser fit and layered it over another tank. It looked great, until I washed it. The raw-edges unraveled a bit. The next wash caused tiny holes to tear in the back near the knot. If you want it to last longer than a couple wears, I suggest hand-washing.",2
"very very cute shirt and really wanted to love it. great fit. sadly, the material is really lacking.",2
"Despite flannel not being mentioned in the name, it's definitely a thick, flannel material. I didn't even try it on.",2
"This is scuba like material, but also felt like foam to me. I was impressed with the rough cut, no seam on the bottom of the shirt, or the foam like feel of the fabric. I returned. I give this a 2 stars because I like the design of this, but the material and the fact it was short on my torso make it a definite return.",2
"Its a cute top, but i recommend buying it one size up. Also very hard to wear a bra with it because of tightness and lace straps",2
"I was excited to try this product and I must say I was disappointed. I am 35 weeks pregnant with lower back pain. I thought this product would help alleviate the pain but unfortunately it was too big! I got a M/L since I am a size 12 pre-pregnancy, and currently wear a Large in pregnancy clothes. I haven't gained any weight except for my huge belly. When I put it on it did not feel much different than not having anything on. It also bunches up in the back making it very visible through my clothing. I will say however that the cold gel pack feels great and seems to make the belt fit a little better. I tried wearing it on top of my clothes and the fit was much better but I could only do that around the house. I also really like the material of the belly band. I'm hoping that as my belly grows the next few weeks it will fit better and I can utilize it comfortably.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",2
"I wasn't even sure how to wear this as it came with no directions. I'm pretty sure I had it on backwards, inside out, and upside down... which didn't matter because anyway I wore it, it wasn't working. I didn't feel much support from this. I was 8 months pregnant when I bought it and got a s/m based on other reviews, but it was tight on me (wish they had some sort of measurements so you know which one to buy). The pearls are nice and I used them separately for my back. I should have spent the extra money to buy a more supportive band that supports on top of my tummy as well.",2
"When I tried the band by itself my zipper kept going down. Then I placed the cloth that comes with the band (so your underwear wont show) and it just didn't look or feel right. It didn't feel secure.",2
"I was really excited about this product after reading the reviews. The fabric panel doesn't look good at all. As stated, your open zipper still shows, so it looks like you are walking around with your fly down and your underwear showing. With your belly, even with a long shirt, it shows. I thought it didn't until my husband said something. Very embarrassing, but he did take me to buy shorts that night. I think I used this for two weeks before that. I only used the short button one, even though I thought I would be using this all the time with all the different parts. Save your money and make your own, or just go get some real pants. (I made it through with 2 pair shorts, 1 capree jeans, 1 pair jeans, 1 pair sweats, & 2 pair dress pants.) [...]",2
"This item was good in the sense that it did hold my pants up but it also always looked like my pants were undone underneath my shirt. You could clearly see that there was something going on. I returned it and bought the BellyBe band and would recommend that product over this one any day. It's essentially a tube top of spandex that fits over your pants hip height but is tight enough that it holds your pants up and because it's tight fitted it presses the buttons down so it doesn't look like your pants are undone. Belly Belt wasn't bad but could be better.",2
"I was so excited to find these but was highly disappointed when I tried them. It didn't work for me at all. They made my pants too loose in the waist! My pants would sag and slip off so I couldn't even wear them out of the house. I should have returned them. Not sure if they would work better for high waisted pants but I wear lower waisted pants. I would not recommend these. Try the belly bands instead.",2
"I am 15 weeks pregnant with my second child and I have not been able to use this yet. My regular clothes are too tight but this does not assist me at all.",2

"I purchased these because my sister raved about them when she was pregnant. She said they were the most comfortable pants and wore them all the time. So I ran out and purchased a pair s/m while in my second trimester. They are definitely comfortable but they do not stay up. I had to continue to pull them up all the time because they would slip down....I wear a size 2/4 pre-pregnancy and they may just run too large...Unfortunately I am not a fan of these pants.",2
"This bra was comfortable but has no padding and there is a seam that runs vertically down the cups that bothered me. I couldnt feel in in the cup but you could see a big raised line even with an undershirt and shirt on top and that bugged me. I ended up returning it and getting something else.",2
"Wouldn't recommend these to a bigger woman (size 18 and up). I had these on no longer than a few hours and I had 2 runs going from the top of the pants down the back by the butt to the seam in the crotch. Was very disappointed as they are super comfy.",2
"i bought a s/m in my first trimester even though i was on the large size of medium before getting pregnant.  they look cute and are comfortable over all but they fall down ALL the time.  they did not stay up at any point in my pregnancy.  i guess they need some extra spandex or something....",2

I am normally a size small and I purchased both the small/medium and medium/large based on other reviews and even the medium/large was almost as see through as tights.

I just wish I had spent a little more $$ and gotten better quality since I anticipate wearing them a lot.",2

"I was excited to find some leggings with a higher waistband since my favorite pair have been cutting right across my belly. These leggings are much thinner than the ones I usually wear and I agree that you do need a long top with them as they are a little sheer, kind of disappointing since it is December. The waistband has been staying up fine but it always feels like the crotch is falling down or too low. I find myself constantly pulling at the material in the thighs trying to get the crotch to sag less. For this reason I do not find them super comfortable.",2
"These leggings were not comfortable, and I'm only 4 months pregnant.  Can't even imagine wearing them as I get bigger.  My pre-pregnancy size is a 4.  I purchased these leggings in a small and they were too small- just too tight all over.",2
"When I first got these I loved them. They are thick pantyhose material, the only issue is when i bent overly they were slightly see through but sadly most leggings are and I generally wear things to cover most of my butt anyways. But mostly they were comfortable, stretchy with losing their shape, and have a little bit of suck-in factor. But it all went terribly wrong on day 3 when not only did they snag ever so lightly and get a HUGE run in the butt and all up my leg, and then the crotch got a massive 3 inch gaping hole. No thanks.",2
"I wore these one time and they started to pill right away between the thighs, and I have thin legs so it wasn't a situation where they were rubbing excessively. The fabric IS nice and thick but they look terrible with all of the pills on them.",2
"Not comfortable for skin, pill very easily and fall down very easily. Not match the price at all. Got Mossimo yoga pants which is much better with half price.",2
"I noticed right away that the fabric, while thick, tends to pill very easily.  Also, they fall down.  I have found other thick leggings or pencil pants that hold their shape much better.",2
"40DD/E here.  A pumping bustier is a must-have, but this one was very disappointing, as the zipper broke after I had used it only a few times.  I bought another brand (available on this website!) that was much sturdier and better fitting.  Get that one, not this one!",2
"I was so excited to start using the bustier, as I recently returned to work and really need to use my pumping time working and not just sitting here holding the pump!  Well, I was only able to use it TWICE.  Granted, those two uses were awesome, because I was able to multitask with ease...but the third time I put it on, the zipper busted and now it's completely useless...",2
"I was so excited about this bra the first time I used it. It was amazing to finally be able to pump and use my hands. Tonight was the second time I used it and the zipper broke. I plan to bring it back tomorrow. Beware.",2
"I've only had it 2 weeks and the zipper broke.  The sizing said I needed a small, but I chose a medium and am glad I did.  There's no way a small would have worked so the zipper didn't break because I was using one that was too small for me.  For the cost, it's not worth it!  I'm already looking for something else!",2
"for the amount that they charge for this item, they could afford to improve the zipper. it is VERY low quality and constantly pops and breaks which is very frustrating",2
"I bought 2 of these since I've been happy with the other Medela products. There is no option to add straps, & there is no \",2
"A bustier makes double pumping SO much easier and this is a great idea but the zipper on this one broke within the first two weeks. I have been working with it to keep it going but I would recommend going with another brand. It is not worth the money or the hassle.",2
"The ability to pump hands free is fantastic. However, this bra is very cheaply made and has made me more mad than satisfied. I had it less than a week when the zipper first broke. I've fixed the zipper numerous times since then. It should have a clasp or something to help hold it together while zipping. If there is a better alternative, take it.",2
"I loved it at first. It was great to be hands free. The zipper was hard to zip, it was hard holding the bra together and trying to zip. After only having it for 3 months the zipper broke. Would not recommend this product.",2
"I love this bra but my zipper broke after the first use. I can still rig it, but its very annoying. I'm a 38DD and have the XL which should fit just fine...but the zipper breaks every time I try to zip it up",2
"The zipper on this is one of the lowest quality I've ever had to deal with. It is constantly not working which completely defeats the purpose of the bra. I would say 80% of the time I've used this bra I've had issues with the zipper. Maybe total waste of money.",2
"This is an awesome concept & with the right product could prevent your world from pausing while you pump. The zipper broke the FIRST time I put it on (it's poor quality, definitely got the correct size). After using it for about 4 months, I still fight the zipper each time. It takes 10 tries sometimes before the zipper will engage and sometimes I just give up. The price is not right for something of poor quality. I will be attaching prong snaps to it this week.",2
"Love the fact that I can pump without hands but the zipper is terrible! It takes me almost as long to try to zip it up without the zipper splitting as it does to pump.",2
"Mine worked for 3 months but was a pain because the zipper always got stuck. It finally broke completely the other day, prompting me to write this review.",2
"So far I've bought two of these easy expressions bustier because they keep on breaking. The first one I bought had a faulty zipper that popped after around two months use. The second one has holes in the fabric after around two months use. The product is definitely not made with long term quality in mind.",2
"Cheapest zipper ever! I can't believe this is over $30 with a zipper that breaks almost every time I try to use it. I spend half my lunch break trying to get it on!",2
"So, I got this free with the purchase of a breastpump.\n\nThat was nice.\n\nThe not so nice - it doesn't fit.\n\nThe sizing chart says it should fit but not even close. I'm a 42C, so according to the sizing chart it should fit. Alas, it does not.\n\nI was skeptical about it fitting anyway but it would need another like 3 inches to fit. And Target doesn't even sell the larger size.\n\nOh well, I guess I'll be returning this too.",2
"I'm a small person (34C now that baby has arrived) but the sizing on this bustier is totally off. Though according to the chart on the back I could get a size S, the M I first purchased was too small to zip! I managed to cram myself into it once, but the second time I went to use it the zipper split. I returned it and got a size L, and even it seems slightly strained in the zipper. I would say if you are large-breasted this product is not going to work out very well for you.",2
"It was wonderful while it lasted. I haven't even had it a month before the zipper broke.",2
"Was not a 32 f/G, more like a dd, wish they had a bigger size because I am G. The no wire was nice but just didn't fit. I would only recommend if you are a smaller size so order one cups size up or two",2
"two stars because there was nothing actually defective with the bra and it came on time. however, this bra is extreamly pointy, almost bullet bra like. whos breasts are actually shaped like a cone? i had so much extra room between my skin and the point of the bra. id be embarrissed to wear this in front of anyone! it also runs big (maybe to help nursing moms out when they forget to account for growing breasts) its just a weird shape and support.",2
"Oh I really wanted to love this bra :-( when it arrived I thought it looked super supportive and was excited. But then when I wore it, the fit was awful! The band was too small, the cups too large, and there was all this extra material bunching on the sides. I tried adjusting straps and tweaking the fit but its no use. It put my boobs in such a weird position , smashed them together even though there was plenty of cup left on the sides which then just bunched up under my arms. It does have nice wide comfortable straps, but I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to the large busted (I am a 38 DDD or F)",2
"1. too much hassle to zip up and down\n2. Kind of difficult to insert the pumping accessories and take it out\n\nI only end up pumping 10-12 minutes, so did not find it worth to spend few minutes on this.",2
"It worked great when I first got it. I've been pumping for ten months, full time, and the zipper started popping out after seven months. I would have preferred one without a zipper that was solely a tube.",2
"I bought the belly band to help stay in my some of my pants longer and it did not work for me.  The Belly band is ok if you stay standing.  I am up and down all day for work and the band would just roll up and then feel fight and awkward.  The idea was nice but ended up wasting my money",2
"When I tried the band by itself my zipper kept going down. Then I placed the cloth that comes with the band (so your underwear wont show) and it just didn't look or feel right. It didn't feel secure.",2
"I was really excited about this product after reading the reviews. The fabric panel doesn't look good at all. As stated, your open zipper still shows, so it looks like you are walking around with your fly down and your underwear showing. With your belly, even with a long shirt, it shows. I thought it didn't until my husband said something. Very embarrassing, but he did take me to buy shorts that night. I think I used this for two weeks before that. I only used the short button one, even though I thought I would be using this all the time with all the different parts. Save your money and make your own, or just go get some real pants. (I made it through with 2 pair shorts, 1 capree jeans, 1 pair jeans, 1 pair sweats, & 2 pair dress pants.) [...]",2
"This item was good in the sense that it did hold my pants up but it also always looked like my pants were undone underneath my shirt. You could clearly see that there was something going on. I returned it and bought the BellyBe band and would recommend that product over this one any day. It's essentially a tube top of spandex that fits over your pants hip height but is tight enough that it holds your pants up and because it's tight fitted it presses the buttons down so it doesn't look like your pants are undone. Belly Belt wasn't bad but could be better.",2
"I was so excited to find these but was highly disappointed when I tried them. It didn't work for me at all. They made my pants too loose in the waist! My pants would sag and slip off so I couldn't even wear them out of the house. I should have returned them. Not sure if they would work better for high waisted pants but I wear lower waisted pants. I would not recommend these. Try the belly bands instead.",2
"I am 15 weeks pregnant with my second child and I have not been able to use this yet. My regular clothes are too tight but this does not assist me at all.",2
"Wouldn't recommend these to a bigger woman (size 18 and up). I had these on no longer than a few hours and I had 2 runs going from the top of the pants down the back by the butt to the seam in the crotch. Was very disappointed as they are super comfy.",2
"i bought a s/m in my first trimester even though i was on the large size of medium before getting pregnant.  they look cute and are comfortable over all but they fall down ALL the time.  they did not stay up at any point in my pregnancy.  i guess they need some extra spandex or something....",2
"These leggings, while super comfortable, are not a good fit for any woman, let alone a pregnant one... I am normally a size small and I purchased both the small/medium and medium/large based on other reviews and even the medium/large was almost as see through as tights. Went back the same day they were delivered. No one wants to see what color underwear you are wearing. So if you aren't using these leggings as home lounge wear or under a VERY long top, please spare us.",2
"I read good reviews on these and they are comfy, but sheer and a little see through. I felt like my bum had to be completely covered. They didn't have my size in-store, so I wasn't able to try them on. Also, the crotch is kind of baggy.... I just wish I had spent a little more $$ and gotten better quality since I anticipate wearing them a lot.",2
"These are basically thick tights.  I'm returning them - they're too itchy to be comfortable.",2
"I was excited to find some leggings with a higher waistband since my favorite pair have been cutting right across my belly. These leggings are much thinner than the ones I usually wear and I agree that you do need a long top with them as they are a little sheer, kind of disappointing since it is December. The waistband has been staying up fine but it always feels like the crotch is falling down or too low. I find myself constantly pulling at the material in the thighs trying to get the crotch to sag less. For this reason I do not find them super comfortable.",2

Not cute and not comfortable. I tried an 8 (which was too big in the waist), but they still looked like they were riding up in the front (also not cute). And strangely, the thighs were tighter on the bigger size. The fabric was ok, but a little thin. They didn't seem like they would last very long.",2
"This sweater looked really cute online. It runs really large. Ordered according to my measurements and it is really quite big. Feels heavy which I guess is a good thing if you want warmth.

"It was a beautiful color and it fit well. However, you could completely see through the top. Had to return it.",2
"Based on other reviews, I order a size smaller than I normally wear and it fit perfectly. The design is flattering and makes me look thinner and I like the material. I'm returning the dress because it does not have a liner. With the white parts, you can see where the material stops up toward the neckline and it makes it difficult to wear any undergarments that don't match your skin tone. If this dress were lined, I would keep it.",2
"The fabric of this dress is substantial and feels high quality. The construction is done well, however the fit of this dress is very odd. It's VERY short - I'm 5'5 and 135 lbs. I'm a small in most target dresses and that's what I ordered for this dress, and I suppose it was the correct size as it fit everywhere. However, it was SO short - unless you're shorter than I am, I would absolutely not consider this a work dress. The waist hits much higher than your natural waist (again, if you're a petite height this might work for you) and I agree with a previous reviewer that the way the skirt flares out is not flattering and adds a lot of bulk. I had high hopes for this dress but it was such a bomb.",2
"The xxl is more like a large and is more of a crop then a sweater.",2
"Looks super comfy, love the product. However. When I went into the store to purchase it before seeing it online, the original price is $19.99 and it has been marked UP! In store. You can clearly see the original price under the new sticker price and I will not buy something that has been marked up. I was happy to pay the original price but now I'll wait until it goes on clearance.",2

"This shirt is super thin. Not really made for winter and it wrinkles horribly straight out of the dryer. The color is more of a mustard. Kind of ugly. I only kept it because it fits well and will make a nice lounging around the house shirt to wear under my sweater. Not at all worth the $15.00 I spent on it!",2
"These are super thin and wrinkle easily in the dryer. Mot at all worth the $15.00 I paid. Plus this one is ugly in person. I kept it because it fit well and I will wear it around the house under my sweater.",2
"This is scuba like material, but also felt like foam to me. I was impressed with the rough cut, no seam on the bottom of the shirt, or the foam like feel of the fabric. I returned. I give this a 2 stars because I like the design of this, but the material and the fact it was short on my torso make it a definite return.",2
"Despite flannel not being mentioned in the name, it's definitely a thick, flannel material. I didn't even try it on.",2
"Fell apart after first wash. Returned it.",2
"Let me start out with saying I purchased 7 of these cardigans (different colors) and I love the colors, length and how light they are. I was disappointed when I wore this cardigan once and there is a hole in the shoulder/neck area already. The seam opened up. There are also white spots in some seams.",2
"I grabbed this because of the cute pattern and didn't try on because I have always been a medium in all target brands. However this didn't even come close to buttoning across the chest. Very narrow cut - not what I would expect from a sleep shirt. Will have to return. May work if you size up and aren't too busty.",2
"I got theme about a month ago and and just finally wore them. I got a medium big disappointment they are so BIG and they loosened up so very much. The bottoms are so loose and saggy as well as for the shirt it is so big. Wish I would have gotten a smaller size other than that they are comfortable not as soft as I would like them to be due to the fact that the fabric isn't thick and soft rather than thin. FYI even after washing it and drying it doesn't shrink it.",2
"I like these pants but they had a strong chemical smell when I received them, I've washed them 3 times and soaked them in vinegar but they still have the smell..not sure I feel comfortable sleeping in them. They are made in China.",2

"I bought this set for myself and also the toddler's elf set for my daughter. I bought the small size since I'm a size 4. First of all, the concept is very cute and I love the style of the Santa shirt. However, because the detailing on the shirt is that vinyl type material that cracks after several washings, I suggest that you wash it inside out so that you can somewhat prevent the premature cracking of it. Also, after one wash, the white cotton collar was stained red!\n\nMy main complaint about this set is that the pants are poorly designed and uncomfortable around the leg cuffs. The poor design comes in the fact that the pant legs/cuffs only go down to mid calf and the cuffs are tight after a wash or two. In the item photo, the pants go all the way down to the model's ankles, not so in real life. I find the pant legs so uncomfortable that I just wear different red pants with the shirt. I would like them a lot more if the pants went at least down to the ankle. Poor choice by the manufacturer. I tried the medium pants on in the store and they had the same issue even though they were bigger in size. Lastly, I'm disappointed with how thin the material is - it doesn't do a great job of keeping you warm in the cold months, so I usually have to wear a robe over it to keep warm.\n\nThe idea is cute, but the execution of this set is pretty poor.",2
"The fabric is smooth and soft and the design is pretty, but it dyed my sheets pink!\n\nAlso, it's on the clingy side, and the hips run a little bit on the smaller side, so it is not flattering for fuller figures.",2
"Much thinner than expected and the tie is just a piece of wrinkly ribbon. The worst part for me was the color. I was expecting a pretty mint color, but it's actually a dusty, blueish green color that makes it look old and dingy. Besides that, it is soft and the size is accurate.",2
"I bought these on clearance in store for $12, if I would've paid full price I would be livid because these shrunk significantly after washing. I actually came to read the reviews after I tried on the pajamas (after washing) because they seemed smaller and I wanted to see if this item had reviews...low and behold other people said they shrunk after washing as well. Size up and I think these will work.",2
"When I purchased this item, the description said Woman's Fleece Pajama set. This is NOT a fleece item. It is a very thin knit...like t-shirt material. I guess it's fine if you are looking for a thin pajama set, but the description was misleading and inaccurate. Was disappointed.",2
"Sent this to a family member who is wombs size 1-2X , this doesn't fit her. It would be great better if the OSFA gsve more specific description",2
"I grabbed this because of the cute pattern and didn't try on because I have always been a medium in all target brands. However this didn't even come close to buttoning across the chest. Very narrow cut - not what I would expect from a sleep shirt. Will have to return. May work if you size up and aren't too busty.",2
"I bought these for Christmas eve pjs, washed and dried them before wearing, after 1 wash the seam on the leg tore and left about a 4 inch hole in the pants. I wanted to love them because they were so cute and soft but sad that they are unwearable after 1 wash.",2
"Printed design cute; material terrible. Would be perfect made of cotton flannel.",2
"The pjs were a different kind of material then the other nick and Nora Jammie's I usually purchase. I couldn't tell from the pic when I ordered them.",2
"I LOVE the cute prints for this entire line and I bought a robe and matching pants as well as the matching sleepdress. However, if the fit was at all even moderately well designed, I'd buy more in every color. Because it's not, I won't. Presumably to save costs, this only comes in two fits: S/M and M/L. The S/M fits more like a L and is so incredibly baggy with so much excess fabric, I can't do normal household activities while wearing it without getting my sleeve in my soup or getting it in the water while brushing my teeth, and the fabric is too slippery to roll up. It's actually sad that it costs Target less to produce two highly generalized sizes than it would cost them to make accurate sizes and use less material.",2
"These pants are comfortable, but they shrink considerably after the first wash. Worse than that, they shrunk unevenly - one of the legs is now noticeably shorter than the other!",2
"The material is light weight and you could wear them year round. After washing, the red bled into the white/gray material. But my daugher said they were comfy and cute so we kept them any way. If red bleeding into the jammies bothers you, don't get these.",2
"So sad. I received these for Christmas and loved them. Washed them once and everywhere there was red piping, it bled. These will be going back.",2
"The pants fit like capris, not pants.",2
"The cute design on the front of the top was made of a rubbery substance and not just printed on the fabric. It was not soft like the fabric.",2
"The top fits fine but the sizing on the pants make no sense. The waist is too big and the legs are too short. Any time I buy the thermal pajamas from Target, it's the same problem. I just wear the shirt with leggings because the pants are useless.",2
"PROS: The print is really cute - and they are 100% cotton. Those are the two reasons I ordered them. CONS: The material is so cheap and uncomfortable. It's like wearing paper. They softened a bit, after a few washes, but not much. The rolled up cuffs (sleeves/pantlegs) became wrinkled and bunched-up messes after 1 wash. I had to cut off most of that material and resew the tabs back on. Way too much work for that price.",2
"These pajamas fit very differently than other similar Nick and Nora sets I own. I have another set in a small and one in a medium that I wear regularly. These are both roomy on me. I bought this pair in a medium and the pants are snug through the hips.\n\nThe pants have pockets, but they're a bit small. Unlike the men's and toddler's sets that I also purchased, the shirt only has a small shirt pocket rather than the two larger pockets on the bottom of the shirt.\n\nAlso, for all of the advertising of the family pj sets, it was challenging to find all three sets that we needed. The women's were only available in store and the men's were only available online. Nonsense.",2
"I like these pants but they had a strong chemical smell when I received them, I've washed them 3 times and soaked them in vinegar but they still have the smell..not sure I feel comfortable sleeping in them. They are made in China.",2
"wore a L purch. from store. Had to get XL when ordering online. And they are shorter. Not real happy with purchase",2
"I bought this set for myself and also the toddler's elf set for my daughter. I bought the small size since I'm a size 4. First of all, the concept is very cute and I love the style of the Santa shirt. However, because the detailing on the shirt is that vinyl type material that cracks after several washings, I suggest that you wash it inside out so that you can somewhat prevent the premature cracking of it. Also, after one wash, the white cotton collar was stained red!\n\nMy main complaint about this set is that the pants are poorly designed and uncomfortable around the leg cuffs.

"I love these jeans, but I ordered two new pairs in the same size I currently have, and they run smaller than the ones I already have. What's the deal?! Had to return.",2

"I LOVE the material of these pants. Much more like jeans, and perfect amount of silver. However they are so short in the rise I couldn't even get the on and I'm 5'2! So disappointed - I really wanted them to work. Don't buy these thinking they are going to stretch - they run small so order up a size - or 2!",2
"I really like the fit of these jeggings - I have a white and a denim pair that I bought over the summer that I got a lot of wear out of. I find them to be true to size. These fit just as well, but the color is off. I was hoping for more of a camel tone like the photo, but in actuality they are a British khaki. Personally I do not wear khakis, nor do I want it to appear as though I am, so these just won't work for me. If the color was as pictured, these would definitely have been a staple in my fall wardrobe! So now I just have to wait for other colors to come back in stock.",2
"I'm 5'8 & 140lbs. A size 10 fits comfortably loose on me. When I looked up the sizing conversions, I decided to get a 29 since it said that was like a 9\\10.\nThese jeans are SO TIGHT. I could barely get them on. I would suggest buying 2 sizes bigger than normal for these.\nOther than that, they seem high enough quality, & the color pictured is accurate.",2
"I ordered these online like I've order many other skinny jeans/jeggings from Target before. I love the color of these - midtown blue. I ordered my usual size 2 but these seem to run HUGE and have so much stretch that I didn't even need to undo the zipper and button to get them on and off. Also, I realize in the picture that these are ankle jeans, but at 5'6\",2

"Can't buy ANY long jeans size 12 from target online and local store doesn't stock. Bought these to try.Fitted well before I washed them.So full of ink you can't wear them in the Colorado spring as all the color end up on your legs. After washing they don't fit. Shrunk in length and width. Now stuck with jeans that dont fit.",2
"I'm 5'4 just under 120lbs and ordered an xs online. It's cute enough but roomy for an extra small, here's hoping it shrinks some in the wash. A little darker than pictured, it has no back pockets which in combination with the oversize fit has an unflattering flattening effect.",2
"I'm 5'6 and usually wear size 6. these jeans in size 8 were really tight and 3 inches too long! Big oops from Levi! Color was great though! Solid black and great stitching.",2
"...but these were sized strange too. Available in short or long. No \",2
"I received a free sample of these jeans in exchange for agreeing to write a review. I really like the softness of the material, they were very comfortable! This fit felt off the whole time I wore them, very stiff and boxy, and did not form to my body after wearing them a while. The crotch was also bunchy, and that also did not go away after time. Would not recommend for the price!",2
"These pants were oddly proportioned on me and the quality was inconsistent. The waist measurement was correct for me on the size 6, but the rise was too short so they wanted to ride up. Not cute and not comfortable. I tried an 8 (which was too big in the waist), but they still looked like they were riding up in the front (also not cute). And strangely, the thighs were tighter on the bigger size. The fabric was ok, but a little thin. They didn't seem like they would last very long.",2
"These pants are super cute and comfy. I was so excited when I found them! However, within an hour or wearing them the elastic had already broken. I am so bummed. Usually I don't have an issue with the quality of the clothes I buy at Target but these are clearly very cheaply made.",2
"They were comfortable the first time I wore them. And then I washed them in cold water, and even line dried them - and they totally shrunk. If I wanted leggings, I would have bought leggings. Disappointed.",2
"There was much to like about these pants: they were super soft, fit pretty darn well top to bottom (i.e. very true to size, and not dumpy), and were a pleasing color. I really wanted them to work.\n\nI returned them, though, because they have big, exaggerated pockets that draw A LOT of attention to the hip area. There are lines outlining the pockets in a bright thread that made me feel like there were giant arrows pointing directly to my hips.\n\nI ordered these pants because I had a baby not long ago and wanted something that would be easy to wear and easy to get on and off; while these fit the bill in that department, I hated the way I looked in them, so they went back.",2
"These pants are so soft and comfortable, yet the dust of little red particles makes the pants not worth the hassle. I thought it was minor shedding when I tried them on. However even after washing the pants the dust still was there. It's an annoyance and leaves its mark EVERYWHERE! My lint brush has been a life saver!",2
"While the pants are nice and long, the quality wasn't what I was looking for so these were returned. The bottom of the pants legs and the inseam and outseam aren't turned and hemmed. They are just kinda stitched. Also, the waist doesn't have stitching between the drawstring and the top of the pants. Missing that line of stitching makes the pants bunch up funny when you snug them on and uncomfortable. The long length is why I gave these 2 stars.",2
"I have worn these pants 2 days in a row and have already discovered a hole in the crotch and the drawstrings are fraying! The hole can easily be repaired, but I haven't even washed them?? But, they are very comfortable! But I don't recommend, not even to an enemy!",2
"I love how these leggings fit; however they are completely see through. They are essentially footless tights. I am so sad because they look amazing on.",2
"I wore these one time and they were amazing! So cute and comfortable! And then we washed them just like it says on the tag...tumble dry low...the pants shrunk at least 3-4 inches! I have to wear them almost hanging off my butt in order for them to be long enough! If you want palazzo pants, don't get these! While they may be adorable, I'm sure there are much better palazzo pants out there that won't give you so much trouble!!",2
"These were way too low cut, especially in the back. The waistband did not come up high enough. I would have been flashing my butt crack all day. The print was nice though",2

It also looks very unflattering as it cuts weirdly into your skin instead of keeping everything tight and together like high-quality spandex pants do. They were fairly thin and not very stretchy, so I feared they'd rip immediately when doing any kind of workout. Wish I tried them on first; I will be returning.",2

I am looking forward to not wearing these anymore! They get the job done, but there is virtually no support and they are roomy to the point of being loose. My feet ache after just walking in them, so I could not imagine running. No arch support, poor cushioning, poor stability. Not worth the 27 dollars I paid for them.",2

It also looks very unflattering as it cuts weirdly into your skin instead of keeping everything tight and together like high-quality spandex pants do. They were fairly thin and not very stretchy, so I feared they'd rip immediately when doing any kind of workout. Wish I tried them on first; I will be returning.",2

Additionally, the gloves come with sort of a small hole between the thumb and your index finger. You can't probably avoid that with the material. I probably wouldn't buy these again because it's pointless to have this type of gloves if you can't use your phone or ipad.",2

"wanted to like these... they are warm inside, but when you pull the finger tips to release your hands and take them off, the lining and outer fabric pull away from each other... Maybe it's the OSFM- and they really need to go on tiny fingers?",2
"They shed like crazy, as soon as I opened the box the white fluff on the inside lining started to piece off...it gets in my hair and on my face and its just annoying. I'm hoping after a couple wears all the loose pieces will fall off and they will stop shedding because they fit and they're still really cute. If not I will return them.",2

"I had tried on several hats in store, and then ordered this one online. Turns out that the sizing on this particular hat is completely different from the other hats in this line. It was huge on my head and with its wide brim, wouldn't survive 10 feet in a midwestern winter wind. The chain detail looks very cheap compared to other braid options on similar hats. I ended up returning this and getting a better option from the same line at a better price.",2
"Target used to offer nice leather gloves in Sm, Med",2
"It's thin and not warm at all. To be fair, I got it because I'm going through chemotherapy and had to shave my head. If I had hair it might be warmer. But I need something to keep my head warm.

"Love a good gladiator and bought these because the added thickness to sole would give me some height and cushioning but the ankle straps were too tight so I sent them back. Would have been comfortable otherwise. If you have skinny ankles go for it.",2
"We bought these shoes as bridal party sandals and almost every pair was defective. The straps were not long enough to fit around most people's ankles and we had to rig them with extra elastic or by punching holes in the straps.",2
"Cute shoes but they seemed to run a little small. One of them was also defective, the holes in the strap were put right on the edge of the strap so I couldn't buckle them without the holes being ripped out.",2
"I purchased these sandals for an upcoming beach vacation. Unfortunately, they are uncomfortable and don't look very good on. There is padding in the footbed, but it stops before the edges of the shoes, which can cause your foot to slip off. They seemed too narrow to me, as well. The beading just looked too cheap, so I've returned them.",2
"These are gorgeous and they would be comfortable if the plastic thread holding the beads on didn't scratch the top of your foot. I wanted to love them, but had to return them :(",2
"I liked the look of these shoes, and they look nice on others. But, I put them on, left my house, and went to run some errands. No more than 10 minutes after walking in them, they left a blister on the top of each of my feet, that instantly popped. So basically it tore the skin off the top of my foot, and continued to rub on them. I had to slide my feet back off of the shoe and carefully walk, while finishing my errands. It was so bad, I really considered walking to the nearby Payless shoe store to get a pair of cheap flip flops. My feet were blistered and a few days later scabbed up. I haven't been able to wear the shoes since. I'm hoping to maybe wear them around the house with a thick pair of socks to stretch them out a little. I don't know if it will help, as I dont feel that the shoes are tight, as they are. The part that caused the blisters is the bottom leather strap, closest to my ankle, under the buckle.",2
"Most reviews said they dig in to the top of your feet, most reviews are right. First of all the bed of the foot started to come apart after 2 uses. I didn't listen I figured I could find a way for them not too. First 2 days were great I got a lot of compliments. Now I can't wear them at all because I have 3 large scabs on the top of my feet. Ladies, resist the urge..they are super cute but like I said I can't even wear them",2

"Have been buying this style bra for over a decade. Same size every time. Took me a while to figure out why the bras I bought couple of months ago just did not fit like all the others. But, the short piece of elastic on the back of each strap is about an inch shorter than all the others in my closet from previous purchases of the same bra. My boobs spill over the top of the cup with these new bras. I can't wear them and I'm not sure what to do because they fit in every other regard. I wish JMS would fix this problem.",2

"This bra gave a pointed shape that just really didn't look good.",2
"This is not a comfortable bra due to the scratchy lace fabric. Also it rides really high under the arms.",2
"I have bought these bras quite a few times and have yet to find the rubber tips on the end of the wire. This makes it uncomfortable under my arm after wearing it for awhile.",2
"Didn't like the fit. Wrong shape for me. Returned it.",2
"I bought it because it was described as full figure support. It has no support & no lining. Yes it is pretty if that's what you want. It was true to size but I don't like to feel like I'm wearing no bra & look like I'm wearing no bra.",2
"Wasn't too thrilled at the fact there was no padding.",2

"bought one white, one pink. First disappointment: pink is a lot darker than shown. Second disappointment I bought my normal DD cup. The Bali Passion for Comfort cup goes all the way UNDER my arm and is loose at the top pf the cup where the lace is before the strap. NO I would NOT buy again.",2
"Very disappointed with this bra. It is not up to Bali standard. Because of the style, the cup starts way up high and I looked droopy...albeit less busty, but it does not have any lift. (I am in a minimizer for a reason.) :) I have always had good luck with Bali. I cannot recommend this bra at all.",2
"Bali bras have always been my go-to for correct sizing--except for this order. I was recently fitted in a store and determined my usual size of 34DD was too small. The bra I ordered, in a 32DDD, however, is far too large in cup size, in comparison to the one I purchased in the store. Should have ordered the 34DD instead, at least for this style bra. All other features are quite nice and I do like the style. Will order different size next time.",2
"I used to buy the bras with the same name a couple of years ago, and I really liked them. I ordered these recently to replace some of my old ones, and they're not the same. The fabric isn't as supportive, and the sizing is a bit off for me. Some may find the new version more comfortable, but I miss the old one. I returned these.",2
"Unfortunately, the bras did not fit as I had hoped. The cups puckered and were wider apart than my body is. My breasts splayed outwards beneath my armpits. Definitely not the look I was going for. I will have to return them.",2
"I have never wore it, it has this extra fabric towards the top going to straps that kinda bunches up and the wires bulge at the arm which is miserable and it is not true to size..It is awful!! I am 5'2 and a true 38DDD. The material is excellent, but the sizing and construction is not right.\nI also ordered the Lilyette Embellished Keyhole Minimizer Bra at the same time, Hands down the best fit ever!!",2

"It digs into my shoulders. Very it is very uncomfortable.",2
"I will be returning this bra as it just doesn't fit properly. My other Bali purchase in the same size fits perfectly.",2
"I do not particularly like this bra. It is like so many minimizer bras that push the breasts laterally. When I have it on I can actually feel my breasts touching my arms! I was hoping this would replace the great Bali minimizer that has been discontinued - 3642. What a great bra that was. Just lifted the breasts without making them look huge. Please Bali, bring back 3642!!",2
"I bought this bra by default. It was the closest recommendation to what I actually wanted. It's sort of comfortable. But it doesn't minimize anything. It actually created bulges. I don't like it. If I had spent more on it, I would've returned it.",2
"These Bras run small. My size is a 32C and when i arrived it looked like a small girls bra. I ended up giving it to my niece. I would size up abut im worried i will get stuck with another bra that does not fit.",2
"I AM CURRENTLY WEARING THIS SAME BRA BOUGHT IN A STORE. THE BRA I RECEIVED FROM JMS BARELY HOOKED ON THE FIRST HOOKS! I HAVE BOUGHT TWO OTHER BRAS FROM JMS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. ARE THESE SECONDS? I'M NOT RETURNING AS I CAN GET A BRA EXTENDER AND I REALLY LIKE THE STYLE--BUT I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN.",2
"This bra has virtually no support and loses shape rather quickly! I do not recommend this bra to any busty woman like myself. On the plus side the straps and material are very comfortable.",2

"I have slopey shoulders and although I love the support of this bra (and the nice padding to hide the nips), this bra has a big problem if you've got big breasts: The strap adjusters slip like crazy. If you have small shoulders and you need to shorten them, they pretty much slide down to maximum length as soon as you cinch them up. I've had to do the bra-adjustment dance in the ladies room at least four or five times a day because my straps are constantly too long and won't stay adjusted.

"Don't like this bra as the band under/between cups is very loose to the point it feels already stretched out. Wish I hadn't purchased 2 as I will never wear these. Wasted money.",2
"Comfortable but does not separate breasts and rides up",2
"I really wish you carrriec this in 34 DD. I notice your 34 for this style doesn't go past C. I ordered 36 DD and its too big. May try going down to 36D. All over I like the way it feels it just doesn't fit.",2
"The fabric is too stretchy. It makes you feel you're floating in the cup. As the fabric looses elasticity, there wouldn't be enough hooks to make small enough. Size smaller doesn't enough hooks to make larger if needed. Returned everything.",2
"This bra runs really large in the band. The foam cups are NOT ultra-thin. They are thick, bulky and ugly. I felt like I was wearing armor.",2
"Does outfit like any other bali bra. Runs ver small and band rolls up. This bra is going back",2
"I don't like the product. It has too much padding and not enough support. The back is very small with just 3 hooks. I do not find it comfortable.",2
"No under wire, that is good. Down with underwire!!!The \",2
"I like a more natural look, so for me the padding was too much. The size was fine and it was comfortable.",2
"The bra may feel comfortable, but it is not supportive at all. I am a 38B, not large, and didn't think it gave an attractive look under clothes.\n\nI will stick to the underwire U style bras.",2
"Within 6 months of purchase of this bra, the inner liner at the bottom of the cups has become floppy and does not support. It wants to fold back on itself. I have to carefully position it when putting the bra on. (Proper care instructions have been followed.) Also, the sizing is inconsistent. I purchased some in white and one nude, all the same size, at the same time. The nude is larger than the white ones. Finally, I have shortened the straps as much as possible and they are still too long.",2
"The bra was ok. However, I ordered it in Lilac and the color looks awful when I recieved it. It does not look like the color in the picture. The color looks like when you put something white in the wash with blue jeans, and it gets that dingy blue coloring to it.",2
"Not enough comfort in straps, and the support is only average. I sent it back for Comfortflex Seamless Wirefree bra which is better for me.",2
"I ordered this bra in a size larger than I normally wear because it is cotton, and was allowing for shrinkage. When I received it and tried it on, I found it ran snug, and not true to size. I am find this to be the case with most of your bras! All my other bras are a size smaller and a cup size smaller, and they fit just fine. I will have to wash this bra in cold water and wear an extender with it if I decide to keep it, or send it back!",2
"I got this bra and I absolutely love it except for the fact the it doesn't fit.. The cup size was way to small. It's gorgeous though.",2
"I had to return. Didn't realize it was Playtex when purchased. Bought in a 40DDD.",2
"Too much padding in the cups, uncomfortable. Didn't like the way it looked under clothes.",2
"I ordered this Playtex just to try another brand other than Bali. And I am disappointed. It isn't comfortable and it doesn't fit well. I guess I am spoiled.",2
"This product is shown having a smooth rounded look...it's not. It makes my breast look pointy and the lace is somewhat itchy. I only ordered one of these while on sale and ordered one of the Playtex Perfect Smooth item#23481. What was shipped was 2 of these, the second not even being the color I had order in the other style which would have been nude. I didn't bother sending back because it's not worth the hassle. I would not recommend this to anyone not wanting to look like Madonna in the '80's. The bra I prefer is an item# 4597 (I think it's changed) which doesn't seem to be getting replenished.",2
"I ordered same style number and size of the one I bought in the store. They do not look or fit the same.",2
"Very pretty but doesn't fit like other Playtex bras I have. The cups are on the small side and pointy.",2
"It is an OK bra but I would probably never get anymore. There's just something that doesn't feel right about it",2
"It really wasnt a very good fit. The shape of the cups were not smooth enough",2
"Ive ordered this bra many times, always perfect fit until now. Cups too small, band won't fasten. Very disappointed. Do they have a new fit model, or perhaps mismark in size?",2
"I wish the bra had fit the way it looks in the picture, but had to return due to unflattering fit for my body.",2
"The material rubs my skin raw under my breasts, it does have good coverage and the should straps are thick enough to support well.",2
"1. too much hassle to zip up and down\n2. Kind of difficult to insert the pumping accessories and take it out\n\nI only end up pumping 10-12 minutes, so did not find it worth to spend few minutes on this.",2
"It worked great when I first got it. I've been pumping for ten months, full time, and the zipper started popping out after seven months. I would have preferred one without a zipper that was solely a tube.",2
"two stars because there was nothing actually defective with the bra and it came on time. however, this bra is extreamly pointy, almost bullet bra like. whos breasts are actually shaped like a cone? i had so much extra room between my skin and the point of the bra. id be embarrissed to wear this in front of anyone! it also runs big (maybe to help nursing moms out when they forget to account for growing breasts) its just a weird shape and support.",2
"Oh I really wanted to love this bra :-( when it arrived I thought it looked super supportive and was excited. But then when I wore it, the fit was awful! The band was too small, the cups too large, and there was all this extra material bunching on the sides. I tried adjusting straps and tweaking the fit but its no use. It put my boobs in such a weird position , smashed them together even though there was plenty of cup left on the sides which then just bunched up under my arms. It does have nice wide comfortable straps, but I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to the large busted (I am a 38 DDD or F)",2
"This is too short in the shoulders. I have a long torso and am long through the upper chest to my shoulders. Finding bras that don't pull down on my shoulders is always a challenge. This is definitely uncomfortable. I'm going to return it.",2
"The bra fits okay, but there is a slight pull at the bottom of the cups. The bottom is a bit scratchy. Overall, its uncomfortable to wear all day long.",2

"This bra would have been great for a petite body with small breasts if it weren't for the irritating plastic attachment of the straps to the cups in front. Both sides bothered me and I had to discard the bra after two days of wear.",2
"This is very nice in Fuchsia, but only fits when you first put it on. I'm a 34B, and ordered a Small, but the Small just pushes my breasts together after a few minutes, and everything is squishing out. It probably would be good for a teenage 34B. I might try the Medium.",2

"Product was returned. Though I ordered the bra size I always wear, it was far too small. Also didn't realize how thick the cup padding would be...too heavy and stiff for comfort, in my view. I like the design and thought the fabrics and construction were nice.",2

"I bought this bra a few months ago, but should have returned it after trying it on. I kept it because it's so pretty, but the underwire weirdly curves outward and digs into the underside of my triceps when my elbows are touching my ribs. Although I bought the correct band size (42D), the bottom curve of the underwire pinches my ribs, and I'm well-padded there, LOL! The cup fabric is soft and stretchy, and doesn't shape as much as I'd like, despite the underwire. There was some nipple show-through during cold weather.",2
"This bra is very uncomfortable. Not enough padding around the underwire. Also runs a tad small.",2
"Sending back. Horrible fit. Gonna get aware from playtex and try something else. They arent what they used to be",2
"This bra was very comfortable, good overall fit and I like the comfort straps, however, it is lacking substantially in Side Support and the under arm is also to low. I was truly disappointed.....it would have been a great summer bra! This one had to go back :-(",2
"I have, as many of us do, bras in many sizes. I even have this bra from a couple of years ago. They fit perfectly, and are still comfortable.\nI needed a few more. I have been lifting weights and feel broader, so I sized up for this order.They are not only tight, but loose. The band is too small, and the cups are too loose, despite ordering different sizes-- smaller cups/broader band-- in 3 combinations. NONE of them are right. As a Plus-size person, I do this mull sizing to make sure my bras are right. So, I repeat: None of them are right. They all fit, kind of, but none are great. I did not return them because it would have cost me more than the bras are worth.",2
"Does not support well. I will not be buying this in the future.",2
"Bra dug into my skin, flattened out breasts, and was uncomfortable.",2
"The bra came with a round stain on returning to store. Returning to store. Also returning other one as I don't like the fit.",2
"It might have been a decent bra, however i couldnt get it fastened. I wear the same size bra in all brands. Havent changed in years. I ordered 2 and couldnt get either one hooked.",2
"I don't like the underwire. I didn't realize it would be that uncomfortable. :(",2
"doesn't fit properly. I ordered three one in black, white and beige and I returned the white and beige. I keep the black because I really needed but it doesn't fit properly. It's too high and pointy.",2
"I purchased this bra about a month ago since I don't have any black bras. I am usually a 34DD, which is what I ordered the first time. It fit around but my chest was poking out around the plunge. So I exchanged it for a 36DD hoping that would fix it. Now it fits everywhere except the nipple area. It's so weird. Like my boobs aren't pointy enough for the bra. Just a weird fit. Maybe I should have gone with a 36D but we'll never know because I already took the tags off...",2
"The padding wasn't as thick as I remembered. The wire and the fabric rubbed my skin pretty bad the first time I wore this bra. I almost returned it but gave it a 2nd chance and it was better the 2nd time I wore it. Overall the quality of this bra doesn't seem to be as good as the first time I purchased one years ago. I will keep it and wear it but probably not purchase again.",2
"This is my 2nd purchase. I was so happy with my first purchase, that was why I made another. But I am disappointed with this bra, it's not comfortable and the strings keep falling down (even after I adjusted them). I got the same size with my first purchase (36B) but still it doesn't fit right. I expected it would be as nice as my first bra purchased (Maidenform(r) Comfort Devotion(tm) Embellished Extra Coverage Bra), that was why I bought 2 bras this time. But these two aren't as good.",2
"The cup was way too small, to be a D. I have gotten D's before, and they fit great. And with the price of shipping it to myself and then having to send it back, I'm disappointed to say that it not worth even the shipping, let alone the actual price of the item.",2
"Ran small...not true to size. Returned it. It was too tight.",2
"This is a comfortable bra that fits well. If only the straps would stay up and not slip off my shoulders every five minutes. It is very distracting to be in the middle of a meeting or a sales presentation and have to think about bra straps slipping off my shoulders. I would NOT buy this bra again.",2
"Have gotten these bras for years, but notice that the quality seems to get worse each year. Never had a problem with being poked by the underwire until this most recent shipment. The fabric is also not as soft as it used to be. Guess I have to upgrade next time.",2
"Size is way too small for the standard size I wear! And, I returned it and never got confirmation!",2
"The bra has a poor fit and it shapes oddly. I, however, definitely doesn't show under your shirt.",2
"I liked the design and the price so I purchased 3 of them but the cup shape is very narrow and doesn't cover entire breast. One of them had a twisted strap and I wasn't able to fix it.",2

"I returned them. They were too large and the cup size didn't match what I wanted. They weren't up to Hanes usual great quality.",2
"Very uncomfortable. Elastic rubbed against my skin and irritated it.",2
"I found this bra to be very uncomfortable. Very scratchy with almost a heavy feeling to it. Won't buy again.",2
"very small for its size. I had to quit wearing it because it would slide off my breasts and go all the way up to my collar bone, very uncomfortable. The Bali bra I previously ordered and loved is no longer available so I thought I would try this one/ Not good!!!",2
"I wear a 46G/48DDD - I've ordered several bras over the last two weeks, all of them in those two sizes. They all fit perfectly with the exception of this one. It came nowhere close to fitting.....not even close enough to be able to use a bra extender.\nMaybe it fits differently for the smaller cup sizes, I don't know - but it is definitely getting returned.",2
"Other reviews mentioned it ran small (band, cups and straps) and I should have listened. As a long-time DD wearer this was my first venture with a G-cup and since straps are typically too long I thought I would still be ok - but I was wrong. I've never had a bra fit so tight, but still gave it a try for a couple days. However, I will be returning this bra, which was too uncomfortable even though the support was great. Very disappointing.",2
"I usually have to wear these straps tightened to about 3/4 of length. However with this one and the other like it in another color, I have to tighten as far as the shoulder straps will go and its still on the loose side. I don't know why but I'm not very happy about it. Otherwise bra seems as others I've gotten like this.",2
"i really loved this bra for the minimizing effect but...the bra does not hold up to wash and wear very well, it is very pretty tho and the shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable, but the shaping isn't natural looking under my clothes. I have since switched to the passion for comfort minimizers and am very satisfied with the quality, comfortable fit and flattering shaping, the material is super soft unlike this bra which feels too constricting even for a minimizer.",2
"I have purchased several bras from JMS and this bra would have to rate at the \",2
"I ordered my usual size 40G, but this bra hurt within 2 hours. I finally had to take it off. The underwire left red marks on my front under the bra line. I don't know if it just fit wrong or if it was bad design. Since the other reviews are good i'm puzzled and disappointed. Its pretty. I bought pink.",2
"I've worn this style for years and as a heavy-chested female, I appreciate a properly supportive bra. This time I was really disappointed. Instead of 4 hooks, the closure has been reduced to 3 hooks, which did not feel as stable.\n\nThe worst part is the underwire popped through the fabric after 2 wearings. I didn't want to be difficult, so I just stitched it up myself. The next time i wore the bra, the underwire popped out of the other side of the fabric. Essentially, I wasted my time and my money.",2
"I bought this bra because I need a minimizer but the straps are way too short so you must be making this bra for very short women. Too boot, even when the straps are extended to the fullest I still feel as if I am being strangled. I purchased two of them and will be returning them.",2
"I have been wearing this bra for years as I love the minimizing effects. HOWEVER, I buy too frequently due to wire always coming out (breaking) and I hand wash and hang dry. It also protrudes in the front and the bow has to be cut off. Wish I could find a better minimizer with more color choices for my size. If you are only going to have one color it should be nude.",2
"This Bra is a good fit for your breasts but the middle part of the bra where the cute bo is located, it sticks out and pushes through your clothing. Its worst when you have a form fitting shirt on.",2

"I was so excited to start using the bustier, as I recently returned to work and really need to use my pumping time working and not just sitting here holding the pump!  Well, I was only able to use it TWICE.  Granted, those two uses were awesome, because I was able to multitask with ease...but the third time I put it on, the zipper busted and now it's completely useless...",2
"I was so excited about this bra the first time I used it. It was amazing to finally be able to pump and use my hands. Tonight was the second time I used it and the zipper broke. I plan to bring it back tomorrow. Beware.",2
"I've only had it 2 weeks and the zipper broke.  The sizing said I needed a small, but I chose a medium and am glad I did.  There's no way a small would have worked so the zipper didn't break because I was using one that was too small for me.  For the cost, it's not worth it!  I'm already looking for something else!",2
"for the amount that they charge for this item, they could afford to improve the zipper. it is VERY low quality and constantly pops and breaks which is very frustrating",2
"I bought 2 of these since I've been happy with the other Medela products. There is no option to add straps, & there is no \",2
"A bustier makes double pumping SO much easier and this is a great idea but the zipper on this one broke within the first two weeks. I have been working with it to keep it going but I would recommend going with another brand. It is not worth the money or the hassle.",2
"The ability to pump hands free is fantastic. However, this bra is very cheaply made and has made me more mad than satisfied. I had it less than a week when the zipper first broke. I've fixed the zipper numerous times since then. It should have a clasp or something to help hold it together while zipping. If there is a better alternative, take it.",2
"I loved it at first. It was great to be hands free. The zipper was hard to zip, it was hard holding the bra together and trying to zip. After only having it for 3 months the zipper broke. Would not recommend this product.",2
"I love this bra but my zipper broke after the first use. I can still rig it, but its very annoying. I'm a 38DD and have the XL which should fit just fine...but the zipper breaks every time I try to zip it up",2
"The zipper on this is one of the lowest quality I've ever had to deal with. It is constantly not working which completely defeats the purpose of the bra. I would say 80% of the time I've used this bra I've had issues with the zipper. Maybe total waste of money.",2
"This is an awesome concept & with the right product could prevent your world from pausing while you pump. The zipper broke the FIRST time I put it on (it's poor quality, definitely got the correct size). After using it for about 4 months, I still fight the zipper each time. It takes 10 tries sometimes before the zipper will engage and sometimes I just give up. The price is not right for something of poor quality. I will be attaching prong snaps to it this week.",2
"Love the fact that I can pump without hands but the zipper is terrible! It takes me almost as long to try to zip it up without the zipper splitting as it does to pump.",2
"Mine worked for 3 months but was a pain because the zipper always got stuck. It finally broke completely the other day, prompting me to write this review.",2
"So far I've bought two of these easy expressions bustier because they keep on breaking. The first one I bought had a faulty zipper that popped after around two months use. The second one has holes in the fabric after around two months use. The product is definitely not made with long term quality in mind.",2
"Cheapest zipper ever! I can't believe this is over $30 with a zipper that breaks almost every time I try to use it. I spend half my lunch break trying to get it on!",2
"So, I got this free with the purchase of a breastpump.\n\nThat was nice.\n\nThe not so nice - it doesn't fit.\n\nThe sizing chart says it should fit but not even close. I'm a 42C, so according to the sizing chart it should fit. Alas, it does not.\n\nI was skeptical about it fitting anyway but it would need another like 3 inches to fit. And Target doesn't even sell the larger size.\n\nOh well, I guess I'll be returning this too.",2
"I'm a small person (34C now that baby has arrived) but the sizing on this bustier is totally off. Though according to the chart on the back I could get a size S, the M I first purchased was too small to zip! I managed to cram myself into it once, but the second time I went to use it the zipper split. I returned it and got a size L, and even it seems slightly strained in the zipper. I would say if you are large-breasted this product is not going to work out very well for you.",2
"It was wonderful while it lasted. I haven't even had it a month before the zipper broke.",2
"The material of this bra is beautiful however the cups have somewhat of a unflattering shape. They are more cone shaped and have nothing to round out the shape. So brass are very giggly and pointy. The bra is comfortable but not flattering. I'm sending it back.",2
"Sorry, Wanted to like this but it made puckers under all my clothes where the seam goes across the breast. I filled out the cup fully so it is not that it was crinkled because cup was not full. Just bad design for my body so returning.",2
"It is very pretty but has zero padding and the seams puckered after washing. That does not look good under knit shirts.",2
"The material feels rather cheesy, and while the bra fits fine the cup is rather pointed, reminding me of a bra from a former era. I'll wear it around the house but not in public!",2

"The elastic in the bra is not strong enough. Becomes loose with 2 or 3 washings.\nI am hoping the mfg's will go back to the better elastic and material in the bra.",2
"While it is very supportive and comfortable for large gals, it shapes the girls into an unattractive high pointy pair. Sorry-the 50's retro look is not for me.",2
"fit is good. however straps will not stay adjusted and will not stay on the shoulders. have worn for years and this problem just started. guess i will have to shop for something different. not going to pay this much and have to make sewing adjustments to wear them.",2
"I have worn this bra for many years. It fits beautifully, wears well and washes like a charm. It is very comfortable, supports without binding. Newer styles all seem to run smaller and have really short straps! I send them back and order more of this style! Please don't discontinue this one!!",2
"First time I did not like the playtex bras I purchased. While they are pretty and comfortable, they are made so that you basically have two points sticking out and it looks ridiculous in a garment.\nI definitely would not recommend these two and wish I could return them, but I have worn them and washed them and I don't have the receipt any more. I have tried other plaxtex Bras that I like much better.\nI",2
"I found this bra to be too big in general. The material between the cups is very large (in width and height) and very uncomfortable for me. The band width was fine (since it is adjustable) but the cup size also seemed a whole size larger. It was itchy as well. In my personal opinion, it just wasn't the bra for me. But maybe a larger, taller woman would benefit more from it.",2

"The cup area fits well and is very soft and comfortable, as does the back and sides. The shoulder straps are very narrow, and sewn with some \",2
"I was pleased with the feel of the bra but couldn't get past the straps cutting into shoulders. Unfortunately will have to return the item.",2
"Was expecting to see a difference in the bulging at the bra line in back and under arms, but there was no difference than other bras. It may sevice smaller and/or firmer busted women, but did not offer the added support less firm bodies require, from the thin straps to the lightweight fabric. Just disappointing after reading the item details and specific purposes the bra was supposed to address. I am planning to send it back.",2
"There is not adequate side and back support so bulges just stick out all over the place. My upper body is not that oversized, but I wanted a firmer fit under more clingy clothes. This bra does not do it for me. It fits like a poorly crafted sports bra with no support. I'll keep it, but only for weekend, stay in the house and get sweaty work - not for going out.",2
"The bra fit well; it's just that the straps are so narrow that they are murder on your shoulders. Honestly, I had to take the thing off immediately because the straps hurt that much.",2
"Had high hopes for this bra but it just doesn't fit me well. I have very small, droopy breasts and was thrilled to find a pretty bra in a 42B. The fabric is stiff, and the bra rides up in front on me. The cups are also too big for me, not by a lot, but enough so they get wrinkly under my clothing.",2
"I was disappointed that the straps were so thin and would not adjust to long enough length, thus to bra keeps riding up and is very uncomfortable. Cup size was okay. No support.",2
"I would really have loved this bra but the straps are too thin and makes the bra uncomfortable to wear for more than a little while. The cup size does run a little small also. JMS discontinued the bra that fit me just perfect and have been trying to find a bra that is as comfortable! If only the straps would have been a little wider and a little longer this would have been that bra.",2
"I bought this bra about a few weeks ago. It is too light weight for me and everything shows through. I don't think I am big breasted, but my nipples show through in this bra. I can't wear it unless I am wearing a sweater over a blouse. It is very comfortable.",2
"I bought this a month ago and really was disappointed. the c cup was not true to size it is bigger and wrinkles up and the underwire keeps flipping up and bunching",2
"I will be returning this item. I tried it on x3.. The material against body is scratchy. Fit: The bra is \",2
"Not enough support but comfortable. I would not buy this bra again.",2
"Thought the bra had soft, lightly padded cups. It does not. Bought a beige and a white bra. Not happy with the purchase.",2
"Usually I like Bali bras and they fit very well, this one is made of scratchy material that irritates my skin and the wires poke into the flesh under the arms, the material on the top of the back closure is constantly rubbing and very uncomfortable, can not recommend",2
"I purchased 2 of this style bra and both had puckering cups. The 2 ply cups were not the same size. The outer layer on one side was larger than the inside layer on each of the bras. Therefore, the pucker. Very disappointed. It was like they were seconds. Sent both back.",2
"I wear a 38DDD and am fair skinned. I purchased 2 of these bras a couple of years ago and wear them only when I run out of clean bras. I love the cup. It's soft, comfortable, and shapely with it's supporting petals, however, the spandex band is unlined and itches my skin. It's not just the unlined spandex but the filament type thread they use for the edging detail on the band and straps that scratches. After a few hours of wear I get used to it, but it's a relief when I take it off at night. If they would line the band as they do with Bali's Passion for Comfort bra I would purchase it again and again.",2
"I felt this bra was not was I was looking for. The straps are not elastic, which I prefer,and I felt overall it was not very supportive.",2

"I bought this bra about a few weeks ago. It is too light weight for me and everything shows through. I don't think I am big breasted, but my nipples show through in this bra. I can't wear it unless I am wearing a sweater over a blouse. It is very comfortable.",2
"I bought this a month ago and really was disappointed. the c cup was not true to size it is bigger and wrinkles up and the underwire keeps flipping up and bunching",2
"I will be returning this item. I tried it on x3.. The material against body is scratchy. Fit: The bra is \",2

"I wear a 38DDD and am fair skinned. I purchased 2 of these bras a couple of years ago and wear them only when I run out of clean bras. I love the cup. It's soft, comfortable, and shapely with it's supporting petals, however, the spandex band is unlined and itches my skin. It's not just the unlined spandex but the filament type thread they use for the edging detail on the band and straps that scratches. After a few hours of wear I get used to it, but it's a relief when I take it off at night. If they would line the band as they do with Bali's Passion for Comfort bra I would purchase it again and again.",2

"Loved the design, fabric and ability to wear as racer back style. I was really disappointed that the sizing for this particular style was way off for me. I ordered an XL, and the band fit, but the cut of the bra did not match my breast size. The fabric did not cover the outer breast area, and it was too small. For the price, I was not satisfied, so I opted to return this item.",2
"There is zero support for 38DD in these sport bras",2
"I just received this item yesterday and was so disappointed. I went by the size chart and ordered a medium. It should have been marked SMALL. I returned the item for a large and hope it fits!!!!!",2
"Ordered size recommended on size chart - too tight.",2
"I normally wear a 36B and purchased a medium bases on the chart. I find it too tight to be comfortable.",2
"Soft, light weight, but sizes run small............",2
"I used the size chart to order and even though I saw a few reciews these bras are sized small, I decided to go with the size according to the chart. These bras are so small--like two sizes smaller than needed. Very disappointed.",2
"The bra fit comfortably at first but my mid day I was frequently pulling it down to make it fit right.",2
"Sizes run smaller than advertised, although it did stretch out as I wore it. Not so comfortable with a tight fit.",2
"I don't care to much for this bra. It makes my breast look smashed when wearing and doesn't give me the support a wire bra does.",2
"My over-65 friends recommended such a style and I anticipated getting a comfortable bra that provided good support. It wasn't comfortable and flattened me out rather than providing good support.",2
"I ordered a small, but it is very tight, especially under the bust. More like an exercise bra than a comfort bra.",2
"I bought these according to the size chart and they were way to small. They were returned immediately. The concept is good, just not the correct sizing.",2
"I bought 3 of these bras a month ago. I ordered a larger size than the one indicated on the size chart. The first thing I did was wash one. It survived washing and drying and maintained it's shape. Next I put one on. OMG! putting this bra on was so difficult I almost cried. It rolled up and could not be easily unrolled. I finally got it unwound and properly adjusted and wore it all day plus in comfort. I was glad I bought the next larger size. I would not recommend this bra to anyone with mobility problems",2
"I was hoping that the cozy bra would finally be the one but the stretch fabric is nice, the cup size is nice the there is the band. I bought a larger size because the band is so tight. Ruins the entire bra. Add some give to the band and it would be great. The old model was lighter fabric and stretchier, the band was not so tight that I felt I could not breathe. You could do better.",2
"they were to small even though I ordered the same size I had from a previous purchase. I sent them back yesterday. 4/18/2015",2
"Did I get a different bra from others? My bra had wider shoulder straps, a much wider band at the bottom and was not a thin material. I'm a 34B and the medium was about right albeit a little tight, but I'm disappointed that it did not look like the bra pictured. I'm keeping the two I ordered but would not order again.",2
"enjoying them just wish they came in a racer back style love that they cover larger size",2
"Have had this exact bra before (same exact product number), so didn't try on the new ones before washing them. Then discovered they fit much tighter than the previous one (even though I have lost some weight!) These new ones are so much tighter they are not comfortable - what a disappointment!",2
"Very disappointed. Bought because need seamless bra and they no longer carry \",2

The cups are set too far apart and barely cover my areola. No coverage at all. Fine for my husband, not me. I would only wear this for a couple hours on date night with certain clothes. I bought the lift hoping to maintain my perkiness, not increase the size. This is not for my needs.",2

"Lacks side support, boobs push center to underarm.",2
"My favorite bra was no longer available, so I took a chance on this one. I ordered my usual size (34D) but the cups are small. I hate spilling out and I would return this but it is not cost effective to do so. Otherwise, it seems to be okay. Cups are soft and smooth. I think it would be better with 3 hooks.",2
"This bra is very well made and very strong, feels wonderful against my skin However, the cup size is very small. I ordered 34DDD. I wish they would make this with two cup size bigger.",2
"The teal bra & picture don't match. I will be sending this bra back. Not the quality I expected.",2
"I bought 2 of these bras because I love the overall fit and cup, but have found that the 1/2 inch elastic band rolls and does not lay flat. (even after hand washing and line drying) I have 6 bras and rotate them so one bra is not over-worn. My suggestion to the company would be to increase the width of this band for larger sizes. I will not be buying these bras again due to the rolling elastic.",2
"I found this bra to be a bit on the small side (I am a 42C). The biggest problem I have with this bra is the straps. It's hard to explain but I'll try. They feel like they are too far out, like they were too close to my underarms. I was constantly trying to readjust the bra. I gave up and ordered a different one, this one was a waste for me.",2
"I was under the impression that the bra had a little padding inside the cups, but to my surprise it did not. The fabric was too thin and showed my nipples purtruding through the bra. It was very pretty just not for me.",2
"I bought two bras, this one and a Bali. The Bali fits perfectly, the Lilyette in the same size was too small. I usually always buy Bali, so I was surprised at differences between the brands. I had measured carefully, was certain the size was right, so I was not happy that the LIlyette ran small.",2

I purchased the bras mainly to workout in but wearing these and running would be uncomfortable since my chest would be moving everywhere. I will be returning the other three. I will use the one as a sleep in bra only.",2

Also the band is to small for my size, I like the bands that have 4 hooks, this only has 2?\nNot happy at all, and won't buy anymore.",2
"I had big hopes for this bra but I'm just too large for it I guess as I not only didn't get any support what so ever, I couldn't keep the straps up at all.

I honestly think for someone that is smaller, it would be a wonderful fit, just not me. It just seems like \",2
"my complaint is with the man-made fabric in this bra. I have had this trouble with other underwear made from this sort of fabric. First, it shrinks when washed---even in cold water ; it has an SMELL that gets worse as your body heat up the fabric. This is very anoying to me; last it breaks my skin out in itchy rash.

Good luck with that. Smooth appearance though--not a lot of back bulge. There is one patch on the band that is itchy.

"And not in a good way. I am a very well endowed girl - a 38DD. I had brought several of the \",2
"I was hoping that the mesh hipsters would be similar to the mesh tanks I wear for exercise (i.e. athletic mesh with small holes for moisture-wicking). This product is more like fish-net with larger holes and is completely sheer and leaves nothing to the imagination. I guess I should have figured that out before I purchased because the model is clearly wearing a little string bikini under the hipster so that this site can be family friendly! This is not my style.",2
"These are NOT BIKINIS as they advertise on the package! They are more like BRIEFS due to the way they fit in the back. When worn with fitting clothing such as leggings or slim jeans they show print and the bottom half of your booty cheek will be easily seen apart from the rest. That's how soft they are but they are not pleasing to see under denim nor thick cotton fitted clothing as I said before! I'm returning them even though they were on sale for [$]",2
"Bought the item a week ago; love the fit but seams are not sewn properly so already has holes.",2
"I bought these and the product description and picture are not even close. The web site says assorted colors. What I got was a white, gray, black, teal, and two prints. The prints were yellow and gray in color and looked like a table cloth my grandma use to have in her house. I bought them for assorted colors not prints.",2
"I have bought Hanes underwear for decades. This time however, they are SO thin and cheap that they most certainly won't last any time at all.. the look and fit are just as good as ever but sadly, they are made of material you can see through. Which isn't good for all cotton. I am on the hunt for a new brand.",2
"The add says soft cotton. I have to say that I have never bought a cotton pantie that is as harsh as these. I also don't like the elastic band around the waist. It's too thin and doesn't hold up very well. I did buy another style of boy cut that were much softer and the waist band was of the normal style. I would recommend these.",2
"I needed some undies that do not have elastic around the leg area as it appears I am getting an allergic reaction. These panties solved that problem, however I am not happy with the way they fit. They fall very low in the back and I feel like they are falling down all the time. I am built with a small behind and hips and they don't cover well at all.",2
"For the price they weren't bad but they feel to bulky under pants.",2
"Old style was better. Do not like the new fabric or the fit.",2
"I love Hanes but I am not so in love with these undies. The fabric is not very soft and after you wear them for a bit the fabric stretches and sags. I like to wear boy shorts to bed and will continue to wear these but they are not my favorite. On the positive side, the fit is good (they don't ride up my bum) and I was pleased with the colors and patterns they selected. But I would not recommend these to a friend. If the fabric was stretchy I would like them more.",2
"I needed briefs that were in cotton for vacation. Even I bought a size larger because of design it hung down below stomach and wrestle it on long trip. Not for mature women but for juniors.",2
"I usually try and find something positive in a product I buy.  The color is beautiful.  They are far too big to begin with and stretch out all day long. They would not stay up.  I will be tossing these.  Waste of good money.",2
"They're not the boy briefs I was looking for. The middle area is narrow, hardly protective. The only merit is that they're undeniably comfortable.",2
"I have worn these undies for a long time, they're my fave. But I hate the colors I recently received. Who wants all this light underwear? Light grey, light pink, light blue. Ladies of a certain age (from, say, 12 to 45?) benefit from DARKER undies, Hanes. There's this certain bodily function that tends to ruin pastel panties, you know what I mean? Please take note.",2
"I bought a package of boy shorts. All 3 pair fit differently, only one pair fit right. One pair stretched out after wearing them only one day. Two pair had a softer stretchy material, and the other one was a stiffer material. Why if you buy a size 6, is it for folks who wear sized 8-10 pants? Aren't underwear suppose to fit snug, not loose? I used to trust Hanes products, but I don't anymore.",2
"I was very disappointed in the solid boring colors I received.",2
"fabric is not as soft as the old model was....aren't as stretchy/comfy either. Disappointed in this model over the boxer briefs from years ago...",2
"These use to be my favorite panties but the past couple years when I've purchased them the fabric and sewing were horrible. Some of the crotches were very narrow, like only 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Barely would wear a feminine pad. Some had fabric that were really thin causing leg area to stretch and ride up. Some were like bikinis not boy shorts. Major flaw in production/inspection line! They also need to stitch the front & back crotch material onto panty. Feminine pads won't stay put. I've been just cutting them off and use a thin pad as liner.",2
"I didn't see the seams until I took the panties out of the package. I decided to try them. Big mistake. The seams give the wearer a perpetual wedgie and cause irritation where the 4 pieces are joined together. Words cannot describe the discomfort. I will take Hanes up on their offer and return these for a replacement or refund.",2
"I have to say that these are very soft, but I get major wedgies in them. I feel like I'm falling out in the back and I have to constantly pull them down, which is SO not attractive. However if you are just sitting around the house, they aren't bad. I prefer the the stretch low rise briefs instead.",2
"I bought these, wash and dried them prior to wearing and they shrink a full-size. I had bought two packs. And when compared to the unwashed pack you could see a good inch to inch and a half shrinkage. They're cute but buy yourself one size larger than you wear so when they're washed they shrink to fit",2
"I was not expecting pink and purple panties in a pack of bodytone briefs. Disappointed.",2
"I bought these a few months ago and some fit great and some are to small.Why is this. Not to happy.",2
"I bought the same size of this same underwear and they are smaller than they used to be. I compared them to the ones I already had and they are smaller for sure. I already washed them so no return.",2
"I have worn Hanes underwear for years and have been very happy but they are obviously making drastic cut backs in material and elastic now. The sizes are at the very least one size smaller now and the elastic almost non existant! There is very little stretch and it the band is scratchy material. In fact after 3 washings I am trimming off the broken elastic fibers....they are literally already falling apart! It was not only this type but I purchased two others and they are the same. I will be shopping around for a new brand of undergarment until they restore their quality once again!!! The only thing good I can say is that the material had a very pretty pattern and that is sad for a product that used to be a quality product.",2
"I bought these and although they fit fine the material while cotton is not soft like I think cotton should be.",2
"These looked perfect before I washed them in warm water, then they shrink. The material is not soft like the panties I ordered before. I will not be ordering from Hanes again.",2
"They're just another pair of underwear. Nothing special except the price was great for the underwear. Cost more to ship them to me\nThat's what's wrong.",2
"I ordered what was labeled as \",2
"These panties do not fit the way the photo represents. They fit more like hipsters than briefs. They fall at least two inches below the navel. They are also snugger than the plain white (3-pack) briefs in the same size. I would not orders these again!",2
"I am very disappointed. These fit well but the elastic is so cheap that every time I wear them or launder them, huge amounts of elastic unravel.",2
"I have been a customer for years but the past few years have not been the same. The elastic is very poor quality and the briefs can't be worn many times until the elastic is totally gone. I believe I will have to switch brands.",2
"I have worn this style of Hanes women's briefs for years and am disappointed at how thin the cotton is on the briefs I just bought. They're acceptable as far as white cotton briefs go, but the quality of the material has decreased.",2
"I ordered the assorted body tone color and wound up with one beige pair and the rest various shades of pink or purple (who has lavender skin tone?) After washing all 6 pairs together per directions I found that 2 pairs now fit snugly while the others all fit a little roomy.\nCannot recommend, quality seems to have decreased since the last time I purchased these.",2
"I've been buying the same Hanes panties for years. I bought two packages, and as I always do, I washed them before wearing them. When I tried to put them on, I could barely pull them up. I compared them to some I previously ordered, and hadn't yet worn after washing. What a difference. They're marked the same size, but look like they're at least 2 sizes different, in both length and width. They're not returnable, since I already washed them and didn't keep the packaging. Also, I noticed the the ones I purchased in the past were actually a softer fabric. The new ones actually felt rough. I'm so disappointed!",2
"I am a male but have worn panties for an extended time as I also have to wear liners.\nI read the reviews but thought that JMS would not attempt to sell something with as poor a quality as what I read. I was wrong. The material is very thin cotton of low quality. Sizing is inconsistent and the elastic bands have minimum stretch. I have gone back to my regular brand briefs, they cost more but at least the quality is there.",2
"I've been buying these for years. The material sourcing and manufacturing has changed. Material is thin, sizing is inconsistent. All in all, not to my liking.",2
"Nothing against Hanes pants, I have worn them a long time. But the pants I received are not as pictured online or in the catalog. They show this style fitting at the waistline, which is what I wanted. When I got the package, the picture was different. The pants fit just below the belly button, the same as style 1A0786 (even though this was style 15802), which I already have plenty of. They really should change the picture as it is very misleading.",2
"I desperately want underware that \",2
"I have always worn this same brief and loved it. This last time I ordered I ordered the same size I have been wearing and they feel at least one size smaller. I am very disappointed in the fit this time.",2
"I bought these panties as I thought they would fit the same as the JMS panties I have bought for years. They are being sold on a page for plus size women. I bought my usual size, but found them to have a very short rise for a full size brief. Not sure if these panties will hold up with washings.",2
"I bought 3 packs of these and I love the way that they fit....my problem is....the fabric. After one wash, 2 pairs of them had holes in the fabric. I was so disappointed. :-(",2
"Although I ordered according to the sizing chart measurements, these were too small and I had to return.",2
"I bought these hoping to replace my more expensive VS pairs, but unfortunately the lace trim is literally trim. The band is elastic covered in lace. This makes for a very unsightly muffin top, as the panties run maybe a size small. When fitting properly, I'm sure I'd give five stars, but since I used another pair of Hanes to order this size, I am highly disappointed.",2
"I bought a similar style for years lace at the top rather than overlaying the top edge. I loved them, though they were always hard to find. When I saw these I grabbed up several packs, but was stunned to discover that they didn't fit at all. It was like they were two sizes too small. The lace band at the top doesn't stretch like the old style--it dug in. I'm giving two starts because the material quality seemed good.",2
"These are cute, but if you are like me and do NOT like the giant side seams digging into your sides (especially when you sleep), these are not the undies for you. If it weren't for this, I would keep these, but they are going back. Just not worth it looking like you've been in some sort of terrible knife fight while sleeping. Too constricting.",2
"The colors that these arrived in were terrible. I never even opened to package. Just returned. I wanted basic colors, not neon ones.",2
"Out of a pack of three - they all fit differently. One fit perfect, one was a little snug, and one I couldn't even get up my thighs. Yet, they were assorted COLORS not SIZES. It is too expensive to order individually, but, if only one really fits in a pack, I guess individually would be less expensive. I will say, the one that fit perfect is super comfortable, and the one that was a little snug will eventually be super comfortable. But the last one, I'll have to throw away or cut up to use as an expensive dust rag.\n\nWhy is underwear so expensive? It's just small scraps of cotton. There are t-shirts that cover me from collarbone to hipbone that cost the same as some of these underwear - and they are made of the same material.\n\nYour quality control should be fired. I read other reviews that said they had issues with size. I shrugged it off. Guess I shouldn't have. There is just no excuse for there to be three different sizes in one pack of three. These items are sewn by machine. There should only be microscopic differences in sizes.",2
"I bought this \",2
"I have bought several packs of these undies, not every pair is sized the same to start with. However, my biggest complaint is that they have made the waistline much smaller. In order to get the waist to fit comfortably (no muffin top) I have to go up from my normal 5 to a 7 and then the legs ride up and the back slides into my bun crack. Not comfortable. In the old comfort cotton fabric (before they went to stretch cotton) I used to wear a 5. So the whole line as gotten smaller, except around the bum, leg opening area. I think I'm going to have to ditch them and only buy Jockey no panty line promise modern briefs, which fit PERFECTLY but no longer come in cottony fabric. I've been buying Hanes panties for over 30 years. :(",2
"Ordered 6 pairs to replace 3 pairs that were so comfortable that I have worn them enough to wear them out. I could barely these on because even though they are called the same size, they are definitely not the same size. Also the previous ones were a nice soft cotton and this is a more itchy material. Might as well not have the elastic wrapped if you are going to use an uncomfortable material. Not happy.",2
"they are two tight around the leg, but the waist is fine",2
"I've worn this style for at least 2-3 years and loved them. Stayed put, did not ride up, comfortable and the low rise was perfect. But the last batch I bought a month or so ago is different. Not as stretchy and not as soft. The tag still says 95% cotton/ 5% Spandex, but it is different. Very unhappy since I purchased 15 and I hate them now.",2
"Pros - Nice weight, soft, feels great against the skin. Washes well.\nFit - As 'new', is good fit on average figure, true to size. Low Cost - especially for all cotton.\n\nCons - Terrible waist band. Does NOT hold/retain it's shape. All 6 pairs did the same. First wearing - the waistband stretches after a couple of hours so much that the pant will literally fall down (and off if not wearing close fitting pants). Requires constant tugging to keep them up.\nDo Not recommend.",2
"These are the only underwear I have found that meet all my needs but these new ones have dropped in quality! Not only are they smaller than they used to be, you can feel the stitching along the waist, they don't stretch like the older versions & the material is no where near as soft & comfy.",2
"So on the picture it shows clearly there is yellow and purple- that is not the case. There is no yellow and purple but instead a gray and light pink in it's place. Also the fit is like that of men's underwear. It's a bit odd and uncomfortable but you can't really argue with the price.",2
"Haines apparently decided they can save a little money by skimping on materials. I have always worn Haines size 6 (for about the last 50 years!) and recently lost some weight so I am about 120# The elastic is narrower (than pictured) so they cut a little and they skimped on the fabric so they kind feel less secure and are definitely less comfortable. I will have to check out other brands... I want the old version of bikinis back!",2
"I at first loved these underwear. Very comfortable cotton, great fit...however after 2 or 3 washes the elastic has started to come out on ever pair's waistband.",2
"I have tried one and saw the stitches falling apart. Others are okay so far.",2
"The band is narrower and hence does not work as well. The sizes in the package are not all equal. I've had to throw some away since they don't even fit me.\nThey are still all cotton.\nPS I HAVE A NEW, DIFFERENT EMAIL ADDRESS NOW.",2
"These are not what they used to be. The elastic waist band and leg openings are much thinner and tend to cut into your skin. Not exactly uncomfortable but not as comfortable as they used to be.",2
"I bought about 25pairs of the bikinis and the hipsters. All of them have the same problem. The Elastic Hanes used used to be different. Now there is an elastic which has a silver thread edging to the elastic. The silver thread unravels on its own without washing them. The result is a waistband that looks like it has tiny bites taken out of it. I would have preferred the older simpler elastic rather than this one.",2
"Instead of stating its a size 2x you should state it's a size 18, becuase it did not fit me at all.",2
"I've been wearing this style Hanes for years. Firstly, they became hard to find in the stores, so I've switched to online. Next, the sizes shrank, and most recently the quality has declined. The elastic in my last purchase has become so tight that I will need to go up another size (again). Not sure it's worth buying again.",2
"I bought this a month ago and was DISAPPOINTED in the \",2
"They're pretty comfortable (no ride-up, non-binding/chafing). Fabric seems very flimsy and they have no stretch. I even bought them one size up and they were still snug. Great price but I won't buy them again.",2
"The package states that they are no roll. THEY ROLL.",2
"I was very unhappy with the purchase of the hi cut panties the material was stiff and not the same quality of cotton panties I used before I returned 7 pairs recently.",2
"I thought that the rubber in the waist band was wider than it really was of a 1/4 of a inch plus the seams are not sewn straight.",2
"I purchased one 3-pack of X-Temp Hi-Cut Panties about a month ago. I use them in rotation with other panties that I have, so they probably get used once or twice a week. I really loved the idea of the wicking fabric and the wide waist band that is slightly below the belly button. I wash all my lingerie in warm water with a cold rinse on the delicate cycle. I dry on the lowest heat. By the second time I wore these panties I noticed the elastic completely breaking through the fabric on the legs. All three pair are having the same issue, and I have very skinny legs and hips. I wear a size 6. I am very disappointed in these panties. Other Hanes panties that I have purchased have lasted for years. Giving these panties 2 stars is generous and is only because the idea was great, but you need to go back to the manufacturer to improve the quality of them! I would like a refund on these panties.",2
"The band keeps falling although the rest of the panty fits.",2
"I've been purchasing and wearing Hanes undergarments for 30+ years. The quality of this item is not good at all. The first time I wore the panties the side seam split on two of the three pairs. YES I am purchasing the correct size.\n\nREFUND please....how do you return used underpants!",2
"I had previously purchased this item in the same size as I got this time, but the new panties were much snugger than the old ones. They must have been mislabeled and a size smaller.",2
"These used to be my favorite, but now they are not as soft and breathable. The fit is tighter too. Hanes...please, bring back the real comfortsoft panties. I am so sad, now I have to find new cotton panties.",2
"I bought a pack of these a long time ago, and they were the best.  I recently bought a new pack, and they have changed the design slightly.  There is now a seam running straight up the back right in the middle, that causes a constant wedgie feeling.  They have become very uncomfortable to wear because of this.  Bad design choice.",2
"I absolutely loved this style of underwear; now I'm kicking myself for not stock-piling it. It was the only style I had found where the elastic would lay flat, wouldn't wear out quickly, and was made to last. The new style isn't as well constructed - the elastic is weak and stretches out quickly and it's far more prone to holes in the seaming. I will do a happy dance if they bring the old style back, but for now, I'm going to have to renew the hunt for a substitute.",2
"I have been a loyal Hanes Women's boxer brief customer for over 10-15yrs. I still own at least 5 different versions of this specific style. Please go back to the old pattern. Although this last batch is much closer to my old ones, they have issues. The fabric is too thin so now the hem rolls up. They are also smaller through the seat which causes coverage issues. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to all the reviews. Were begging. My old ones are falling apart!",2
"Not what they use to be. The fit is not as relaxed as previous \",2
"I was in love with the older version of these and was so excited when I saw these in the stores again. Unfortunately after wearing this new version, I quickly became disappointed. When I first put them on, I noticed that they barely came up enough in the back to cover my rear. Also the length of the legs are not long enough and they seem to roll up. Please Please Please Hanes bring back the older version that we all loved so much!! They were such a good fit and were very comfortable to wear unlike this version.",2
"I was saddened when the originals were discontinued..I have at least 10 pair left and they are getting pretty ratty so when I found these new ones, I was thrilled. Much lighter weight and the legs ride up. They are better than any boy shorts with the seam up the front which were so uncomfortable I threw them out,but still not like the originals",2
"I bought these a few weeks ago. I loved the idea of a cotton brief that didn't bind at the legs. Unfortuantly there would be a great product but they ride up the behind. It is very uncomfortable throughout the day. Fit was good, true to size",2
"If I wanted thong underwear I would buy it. These boxer briefs creep up into the backside. It looks like Hanes went for a more sexy look and forgot that comfort can be sexy too! Time for Hanes to go retro and bring back the style we love.",2
"Bought this product hoping it would be closer to the original design. Waistband is better and the material does not stretch as much as the previous brand. However, is does stretch out when wearing and the way the panties are constructed they tend to give a wedgie. I also found the stitching around the legs to rip easily. I work in an industry where I bend, lift and walk very much and they just don't work as the originals. Sorry Hanes still disappointed.",2
"Please bring the original ones back . PLEASE. I personally can not stand a seam up the back.",2
"Please bring back the original boyfriend boxer brief. Those are THE ONLY underwear that fit me just right. The new version are awful. I know I will pay whatever for a pair of the original",2
"Bring back the old style. They were so comfortable, and were literally the best underwear I've ever owned. The heavier fabric, the gusseted rear seams, they were perfect. The new style is a disappointment.",2
"Each of my hands boy shorts that I own are a size 7 (L).\nWhen I saw these I got excited and purchased some in said size only to be highly disappointed.\nHanes you have skimped on material, and quality.\nMy previous size 7's have more length in the legs and the fabric is thicker and softer.\nThese are so not like what you have made in the past.\nIf they didn't have the hanes waist band they could be a great knock off.\nAnyone purchasing these I will advise to go up a size or two.",2
"These are comfortable but, as others have said, different panties in the package are different sizes - especially the ones with print. And I specifically ordered \",2
"I've been wearing size 7 for years and have many from different manufactures. Ordered these an7 and am returning. Way too small",2
"Thin, not soft. Wouldn't buy this product again. Maybe something else.",2
"Wish I'd read the reviews before ordering :( I've worn these hi cuts for years and loved them. These run significantly smaller :( I bought 2 dozen and none fit. Am terribly disappointed. The quality is good. Fit is not what it was.",2
"I purchased these panties thinking they would be just like the ones in the picture with Hanes on the elastic, but they didn't have the name on the elastic, I felt like they fit tighter than the size they said they were, as compared to the Hanes packaged panties I have purchased in the local stores before, so I was not pleased with this purchase.",2
"I liked them before but the elastic is not the same, not a good easy stretch... some tightness in the elastic itself. I don't think they will wear well.",2
"Quality of cotton was not as soft as previous panties from about 1-2 years ago.\nSizing seemed to run smaller than previously and I don't like the new placement of the side seams which have been moved slightly forward.",2
"I always wash new clothes before wearing. I wash whites on hot.\nThese panties shrunk considerably.",2
"I started out asking for the current equivalent to the former Hanes Her Way Hi-Cut. I was given the product # for the briefs, which I mistakenly ordered without checking. Because returning them would have cost as much as I paid, I took them to a Hanes store (fortunately I have one within a reasonable driving distance). After ordering and receiving the Hi-Cuts, I found them to be a little skimpy. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and was surprised at how snug they are. One pair had such tight elastic that it was uncomfortable to wear. With another pair, the material pulled out of the leg casing on the first wearing. I will have to mend that pair before wearing again. All in all, I was disappointed and will probably look for another brand the next time I need underwear. I loved Hanes Her Way, but not so much with the product that supposedly replaced that product line.",2
"Panties are smaller than size anticipated. Not enough stretch in the entire garment, especially in the waistband and leg bands. Fabric is very thin and can't imagine the panties will last too long wash after wash.",2
"The quality is not what I expected from the past. The material appears to be the correct size, but the elastic has been shorted on all of the pkg. Not true to the size of the garment. I am disappointed with the quality, this is the second time I have found this issue.",2
"Very disappointed not 100% cotton & no color choices.",2
"The material is stiff . Not only that, the waistband on two pairs ripped away from the panty after one washing. I am a loyal Hanes customer , but this is one product I won't be buying again.",2
"While the solid colors were fine, the others were scratchy, stiff, and didn't stretch well. By others I mean the dreaded \",2
"5 out of 6 fit OK, 1 was too tight. I still had ride up on all 6 pairs. I wont be buying these again.",2
"I used to be able to get these in all white but was forced to order assorted as I was told all white have been discontinued. Why? I'm sure many other women would also like all white cotton panties. I only liked the white ones. The colored ones ran small. Very disappointed.",2
"I've worn Hanes panties for years, and been satisfied until the last 2 or 3 packages. I've noticed that solids and prints have a different fit---a vastly different fit. I opened a new package yesterday, put on a solid, and was completely satisfied. Put on a print this mornng, wore it about half an hour, and threw it in the trash. There was absolutely no stretch to the waist-band and the panties were at least 2 inches shorter than the previous day's pair. Thankfully, there were only 2 pair of print panties in this package, although when I buy a package of 6 I expect to be able to wear 6 pair, not just 4. I'm extremely disappointed, and I seriously doubt that buying a size larger will fix the problem. If they don't stretch, they don't stretch. What happened to quality control?",2
"The fit was not good. The panties run on the small side and the fabric did not stretch. I would recommend ordering a larger size.",2
"I feel they are way too snug comared to others I ordered the same size. The waist band is made of much poorer quality. You pay less you, get less, they are prove of that.",2
"I have to agree with those other reviews which state that the new cotton Hi-Cut brief doesn't fit as well as the old \",2
"Comfortable but not as nice as the C9 Premium product that comes in a 3-pack. So, pay a little more and get a better exercise-friendly panty.",2
"Size 8 were more like bikinis, size 9 were 2 in. Higher at the sides.",2
"I just purchased a 3 pack of the X-temp hipsters. Picked up a medium-6 as that is what I always wear. So disappointed with the size, they run extremely large.",2
"These are advertised as hipster panties, and I order two since I had free shipping. I wish I hadn't. They are not hipster panties. They are granny panties! They are actually pretty cute from the front, but the back goes up at least 3 inches higher and cannot be worn with any of my regular clothes. They were also very baggy in the butt as well. I ordered the smalest size, I am 5'3\",2
"These are not comfortable and I wish I could return them. The Medim size is 8-10 which is definitely my size. But the elastic on the legs is irritating... it feels as if it cuts into me.",2
"[...]They are comfortable, but it does not take many washings at all (on gentle settings) for the latex rubber in the elastic legs to start coming through the leg band lining. That's when they need to be thrown out. We always line dry, never use the dryer, but even with extra care, we go through these much too quickly. Too bad the quality and durability do not match the initial comfort, especially for the price you pay. I guess it's time to find a better brand.",2
"Sizes vary within the pack, colors and prints were ugly - overall, not a good purchase and I will not purchase them again.",2
"Sizing was way out of line. Lrg was actually a small/medium.",2
"I picked these up from the store, thinking that they would fit like the cotton stretch hipster panties. Unfortunately, they don't have as much coverage in the back, and the thin elastic in the leg digs in uncomfortably and in an awkward spot. Not the quality I expect from Hanes. I don't think I'll be wearing these.",2
"Seems a little smaller than the one's I've bought in stores.",2
"The hipsters that I bought 2 years ago are beginning to need replaced, but when I purchased a package I found that they were more like bikinis! They ride too low & the waist band is tight elastic rather than the fabric of the panties extending over\nthe elastic as previous . I had to give them to my granddaughter - too skimpy for me!",2
"I've been buying Hanes underwear for a long time, and for the first time their women's briefs shrink, a whole size. I don't like my underwear skin tight. This is huge disappointment. i'm looking elsewhere. I'd have to say they run very small after the shrinkage. I order a 10 so I can't go up a size.",2
"I've been buying Hanes briefs forever. I recently bought several pair to replenish my stock. What a disappointment. I got a variety of colors, and...except for the gray, they all shrank tremendously!!! It's troubling to have that kind of shrinkage, when I've not seen that in the past but...the fact that the different colors shrank differently is impossible to manage (i.e., if I knew they shrank, and could order a size larger.) But...with differing shrinkage by color......???? Very, very disappointed. I'll have to start shopping for a different brand.",2
"I have worn this style of Hanes women's briefs for years and am disappointed at how thin the cotton is on the briefs I just bought. They're acceptable as far as white cotton briefs go, but the quality of the material has decreased.",2

"I ordered a pack for my mother using your size chart. There is no possible way your size 8 matches the chart. I don't think it could even stretch to the point of breaking and still be equivalent to the listed measurements. I also ordered a pack for myself in a 6 (a size larger than usual) and found them to be snug, but wearable. I would definitely send back my mother's if I didn't have to pay for shipping. Very disappointed.",2
"THE CROTCH IS NARROWER THAN ITS ALWAYS BEEN. REALLY A BAD CHANGE FOR ME. I WON'T BUY THEM ANYMORE.",2
"I have worn Hanes women's cotton briefs for years. They have always proven to be of excellent quality, comfortable, and I feel like each pair has lasted for years. However, the last two packages I purchased at the same time were made with inferior waistband elastic. After one washing, the elastic started to fray. Each time I take my clothes out of the washer, there is another long strand of elastic that has separated from the waistband of one pair or another. You undoubtedly have changed suppliers to save money, but unfortunately you have sacrificed quality. I would like to hear that the briefs will once again be sewn with good quality elastic.",2
"I ordered these online because I have a hard time getting the right size in the store, but when they arrived, they were the most awful colors.  Nothing like what it showed online.  They were shades of green and prints.  I had to return them.  The underwear itself is great and very comfortable.  They just need to get some basic normal colors for it - how about a package of black, white and beige??",2
"Who needs dark colors and silly patterns for under light colored summer wear.\nforward this suggestion to our brand marketing team for review -- Its not worth the money to have someone/some robot select the color for me. Your market testing is wrong because your not asking the correct questions.",2
"I have bought these in a retail store here and I love them. However, I am not going to buy them anymore because I have to buy a pack of 3 just to get the one pair of black that I want. I have switched to Jockey even though I like yours better because there I can choose just the color I want.",2

"The fit is good and the waistband is nice. But without having spandex or lycra these panties won't hold their shape and they don't cling nicely to your body. They also aren't seamless so that makes them even more uncomfortable. The whole temp issue is a bit of a joke. I'm staying with the other Hanes panties that are cotton and spandex.",2
"Bought 2 packages of these panties. 3 pairs have had the elastic break or come loose.",2
"I bought these underwear in the size that I wear in EVERY brand of underwear. They are tight, the elastic does not stretch well, and they dig in at the legs. I found a package in the next size larger at a store, and they fit much better. I would recommend buying one size up!",2
"I ordered these with the idea of wearing them during the summer, when it is the hottest! However, I doubt I'll wear them as they are uncomfortable. There is very little stretch and the legs ride up. Sorry I wasted my money.",2
"I enjoyed a soft, smooth material (which seems to be lacking in other styles of Hanes panties lately). They ran a bit small, which made them slightly uncomfortable.",2
"I bought two packages of these and all 6 pairs fit differently. I had high hopes that they would indeed provide a cooler fit as I live in Florida. I was disappointed to find no noticeable difference between these and my regular cotton undies. The wide waste band is very comfortable but I did notice that the are not wedgie proof. Out of the 6 pairs I have one pair that doesn't ride up. It's a great idea but certainly can be improved upon.",2
"look nice ...felt nice , but lost their shape after washing",2
"I have bought several packs of these undies, not every pair is sized the same to start with. However, my biggest complaint is that they have made the waistline much smaller. In order to get the waist to fit comfortably (no muffin top) I have to go up from my normal 5 to a 7 and then the legs ride up and the back slides into my bun crack. Not comfortable. In the old comfort cotton fabric (before they went to stretch cotton) I used to wear a 5. So the whole line as gotten smaller, except around the bum, leg opening area. I think I'm going to have to ditch them and only buy Jockey no panty line promise modern briefs, which fit PERFECTLY but no longer come in cottony fabric. I've been buying Hanes panties for over 30 years. :(",2
"they are two tight around the leg, but the waist is fine",2
"I've been buying Hanes cotton underwear for years. They were always very comfortable and made of a smooth cotton. Last year all of my purchases were not the same quality cotton. Some of the styles were of a harder material and very uncomfortable and even shrunk after 1 wash so, they couldn't be worn.\n\nThey come in packs of 3 and I had some packs where only 1 of them was made out of the smooth comfortable cotton and the others were stiff.\n\nI noticed in the reviews other women are finding the quality issues with Hanes as well. I hope Hanes get a better cotton supplier and manufacture and quality control because as of now, they're uneven and you can't count on every pair in the pack of 3 being a good value and quality.",2
"The description on the Hanes website says they are soft and they are not soft at all, don't buy them, I wish they would refund me",2
"My husband has worn Hanes men's underwear for years, so I decided to give the women's panties a try. They are very comfortable and cute, but when I washed them, the elastic waistband on every single pair began to unravel. I really wanted to like this product because it is much more affordable than my previous brand, but the value just isn't present - I even bought a second package in a different style to give them another chance, but the same thing happened. So disappointing!",2

"I purchased these knowing I was getting a quality product. When they arrived I laundered them as I always do with new undergarments. When I went to fold them and put them away they appeared to have shrunk. The first time I tried to wear them they were very tight and uncomfortable. I double checked the size. It was the right size but I could not wear them. Not a happy customer.",2
"I bought a size larger than I normally wear because of my experience with this brand (Hanes) running small. However, they run so small that I cannot wear them. Other than the sizing difficulty, I'm happy with the quality of the fabric and elastic.",2
"Normally I love playtex.\nThe cups fit well, the front hook has issue, it needs the inner side with hooks need more padding. With lDD size, obviously bra needs strength but it is skimpy on comfort.\nShoulder straps need cushioning, under arms need to be wider to avoid 'side boobs' snd hooks need protective padding lonhger.",2
"Disappointed, paid extra for size 11, but was smaller than the size 10s from Hanes.\nAlso fabric often has flaws that mean holes show up even before first washing.\nWish they were of the same quality as the T-shirts.",2
"The first batch I bought weeks prior fit much better.\nThis batch run about a size smaller.\nI'll still keep them anyway.",2
"Panties are ok but wish the quality was higher. Dont think what i purchased will last more then a few months. Also i HATE not having a CHOICE of colors. I got some in a beautiful blue/purple and so e in an UGLY orange! Who wears orange panties??? The quality is questionavle but big girls do t have a lot of reasonably priced choices.",2
"My main disappointment comes from the fact that these are not true briefs but much closer to hip huggers. This is the second time I have ordered them and was so hoping JMS had gone back to their classic briefs which I loved for many years, alas they did not. The other disappointment is that there is no way to select the color or pattern you want, you take whatever color they send you. I do like that the elastic leg openings are fabric covered but I won't be ordering again because the cut / fit is not what I want. I want full briefs!",2
"Bought two weeks ago. Wore two times and the elastic came apart. Had purchased before and was really pleased but these where a disappointment",2
"These run a lot smaller than they used to. I bought a size 10 before and they fit, but I wanted a little more room, so I bought a size 11. The size 11 is at least 2 sizes smaller than my 10's are. I wished I had read the other reviews closer before I purchased them. Its not worth the postage to send them back.",2
"I've been hunting for panties made in the old style/shape where the side seam is on the side and the front covers from my waist to my crotch. The picture looks like it does but neither is the case. Also thought the 5pack might be a fuller fit. This brand runs smaller than JMS. When will designers learn that not all full size women carry their weight in the rear? We need full and long fronts. Panies are meant to cover not have the leg hole opening reach almost to the navel.",2
"These are not boy short, but more like classic or even hipster type. There's no thigh area at all, though the fabric is pretty comfy. The disinformation is quite annoying.",2
"They are super soft and comfortable fabric wise, but these don't fit like other boy shorts. They cut the back of my legs and will be returning. Hoping to find something else that's comfortable and cheap for after I give birth!",2
"I guess I must have ordered the wrong size or these are simply too short! They don't give adequate coverage in back at all. Super disappointing.",2
"Saw the small crotch comment on another review b4 I ordered and didn't know what to think. Rec'd washed and wore. I have maidenform thongs with more material width on backside of thong then these have in the crotch area. I never thought of my crotch as wide I'm 5'3\",2
"I bought these to wear under my bridesmaid dress for my brother-in-law and sister-in-law's wedding. While they did give me some extra support and comfort in my belly area, they are horrible quality. 3 hours into the day both legs ripped (in the picture you can see the seem right around where the butt and leg area come together). I then spent the rest of the 10 hour day having to reach up my dress to pull up the legs because once they ripped they kept sliding down and showing. If I had still had the receipt and original packaging I definitely would have returned them. Instead, I'm out the $20 +tax. I was not impressed.",2

"Thin, not soft. Wouldn't buy this product again. Maybe something else.",2
"Wish I'd read the reviews before ordering :( I've worn these hi cuts for years and loved them. These run significantly smaller :( I bought 2 dozen and none fit. Am terribly disappointed. The quality is good. Fit is not what it was.",2
"I purchased these panties thinking they would be just like the ones in the picture with Hanes on the elastic, but they didn't have the name on the elastic, I felt like they fit tighter than the size they said they were, as compared to the Hanes packaged panties I have purchased in the local stores before, so I was not pleased with this purchase.",2
"I liked them before but the elastic is not the same, not a good easy stretch... some tightness in the elastic itself. I don't think they will wear well.",2
"Quality of cotton was not as soft as previous panties from about 1-2 years ago.\nSizing seemed to run smaller than previously and I don't like the new placement of the side seams which have been moved slightly forward.",2
"I always wash new clothes before wearing. I wash whites on hot.\nThese panties shrunk considerably.",2
"I started out asking for the current equivalent to the former Hanes Her Way Hi-Cut. I was given the product # for the briefs, which I mistakenly ordered without checking. Because returning them would have cost as much as I paid, I took them to a Hanes store (fortunately I have one within a reasonable driving distance). After ordering and receiving the Hi-Cuts, I found them to be a little skimpy. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and was surprised at how snug they are. One pair had such tight elastic that it was uncomfortable to wear. With another pair, the material pulled out of the leg casing on the first wearing. I will have to mend that pair before wearing again. All in all, I was disappointed and will probably look for another brand the next time I need underwear. I loved Hanes Her Way, but not so much with the product that supposedly replaced that product line.",2
"Panties are smaller than size anticipated. Not enough stretch in the entire garment, especially in the waistband and leg bands. Fabric is very thin and can't imagine the panties will last too long wash after wash.",2
"The quality is not what I expected from the past. The material appears to be the correct size, but the elastic has been shorted on all of the pkg. Not true to the size of the garment. I am disappointed with the quality, this is the second time I have found this issue.",2
"Very disappointed not 100% cotton & no color choices.",2
"The material is stiff . Not only that, the waistband on two pairs ripped away from the panty after one washing. I am a loyal Hanes customer , but this is one product I won't be buying again.",2

"5 out of 6 fit OK, 1 was too tight. I still had ride up on all 6 pairs. I wont be buying these again.",2
"I used to be able to get these in all white but was forced to order assorted as I was told all white have been discontinued. Why? I'm sure many other women would also like all white cotton panties. I only liked the white ones. The colored ones ran small. Very disappointed.",2
"I've worn Hanes panties for years, and been satisfied until the last 2 or 3 packages. I've noticed that solids and prints have a different fit---a vastly different fit. I opened a new package yesterday, put on a solid, and was completely satisfied. Put on a print this mornng, wore it about half an hour, and threw it in the trash. There was absolutely no stretch to the waist-band and the panties were at least 2 inches shorter than the previous day's pair. Thankfully, there were only 2 pair of print panties in this package, although when I buy a package of 6 I expect to be able to wear 6 pair, not just 4. I'm extremely disappointed, and I seriously doubt that buying a size larger will fix the problem. If they don't stretch, they don't stretch. What happened to quality control?",2
"The fit was not good. The panties run on the small side and the fabric did not stretch. I would recommend ordering a larger size.",2
"I feel they are way too snug comared to others I ordered the same size. The waist band is made of much poorer quality. You pay less you, get less, they are prove of that.",2
"I have to agree with those other reviews which state that the new cotton Hi-Cut brief doesn't fit as well as the old \",2
"The look of these is different, than in the picture, also has tacty little hearts with blue dots.",2

Flexible boning for non-rolling is the best feature. Returned. Older shapewear already in my wardrobe is much more effective and comfortable. I'll keep looking.",2

"I was really looking forward to using this product, but I ended up being disappointed. I am nursing and have yet to find a nursing bra they works for me so I have been using nursing camis. The only issue I have is that I am very busty and end up with a lot of exposed cleavage. This product seemed like a perfect solution. The lace was itchy and the material it is attached to is thin spandex. Since this is only supposed to fill in the neckline there is no need for it to be stretchy. It is so thin that it bunches and rides up. This would work a lot better if it was a stiffer material like cotton, ended up returning, might try to make my own, definitely not worth $10",2
"I've had others that were thinner and stuck well so you couldn't tell I had them on under halter tops, etc. BUT THESE are quite a bit thicker stick out like little buttons on your nips and say 'hello' to the world. Does hide the nipple, but looks like a pop cap sticking out. Thinner silicone, please.",2
"These are flower shaped band-aids. That's it. : /",2
"This bra was comfortable but has no padding and there is a seam that runs vertically down the cups that bothered me. I couldnt feel in in the cup but you could see a big raised line even with an undershirt and shirt on top and that bugged me. I ended up returning it and getting something else.",2
"two stars because there was nothing actually defective with the bra and it came on time. however, this bra is extreamly pointy, almost bullet bra like. whos breasts are actually shaped like a cone? i had so much extra room between my skin and the point of the bra. id be embarrissed to wear this in front of anyone! it also runs big (maybe to help nursing moms out when they forget to account for growing breasts) its just a weird shape and support.",2
"Oh I really wanted to love this bra :-( when it arrived I thought it looked super supportive and was excited. But then when I wore it, the fit was awful! The band was too small, the cups too large, and there was all this extra material bunching on the sides. I tried adjusting straps and tweaking the fit but its no use. It put my boobs in such a weird position , smashed them together even though there was plenty of cup left on the sides which then just bunched up under my arms. It does have nice wide comfortable straps, but I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it to the large busted (I am a 38 DDD or F)",2
"Loved the design, fabric and ability to wear as racer back style. I was really disappointed that the sizing for this particular style was way off for me. I ordered an XL, and the band fit, but the cut of the bra did not match my breast size. The fabric did not cover the outer breast area, and it was too small. For the price, I was not satisfied, so I opted to return this item.",2

"It worked great when I first got it. I've been pumping for ten months, full time, and the zipper started popping out after seven months. I would have preferred one without a zipper that was solely a tube.",2
"40DD/E here.  A pumping bustier is a must-have, but this one was very disappointing, as the zipper broke after I had used it only a few times.  I bought another brand (available on this website!) that was much sturdier and better fitting.  Get that one, not this one!",2
"I was so excited to start using the bustier, as I recently returned to work and really need to use my pumping time working and not just sitting here holding the pump!  Well, I was only able to use it TWICE.  Granted, those two uses were awesome, because I was able to multitask with ease...but the third time I put it on, the zipper busted and now it's completely useless...",2
"I was so excited about this bra the first time I used it. It was amazing to finally be able to pump and use my hands. Tonight was the second time I used it and the zipper broke. I plan to bring it back tomorrow. Beware.",2
"I've only had it 2 weeks and the zipper broke.  The sizing said I needed a small, but I chose a medium and am glad I did.  There's no way a small would have worked so the zipper didn't break because I was using one that was too small for me.  For the cost, it's not worth it!  I'm already looking for something else!",2
"for the amount that they charge for this item, they could afford to improve the zipper. it is VERY low quality and constantly pops and breaks which is very frustrating",2
"I bought 2 of these since I've been happy with the other Medela products. There is no option to add straps, & there is no \",2
"A bustier makes double pumping SO much easier and this is a great idea but the zipper on this one broke within the first two weeks. I have been working with it to keep it going but I would recommend going with another brand. It is not worth the money or the hassle.",2
"The ability to pump hands free is fantastic. However, this bra is very cheaply made and has made me more mad than satisfied. I had it less than a week when the zipper first broke. I've fixed the zipper numerous times since then. It should have a clasp or something to help hold it together while zipping. If there is a better alternative, take it.",2
"I loved it at first. It was great to be hands free. The zipper was hard to zip, it was hard holding the bra together and trying to zip. After only having it for 3 months the zipper broke. Would not recommend this product.",2
"I love this bra but my zipper broke after the first use. I can still rig it, but its very annoying. I'm a 38DD and have the XL which should fit just fine...but the zipper breaks every time I try to zip it up",2
"The zipper on this is one of the lowest quality I've ever had to deal with. It is constantly not working which completely defeats the purpose of the bra. I would say 80% of the time I've used this bra I've had issues with the zipper. Maybe total waste of money.",2
"This is an awesome concept & with the right product could prevent your world from pausing while you pump. The zipper broke the FIRST time I put it on (it's poor quality, definitely got the correct size). After using it for about 4 months, I still fight the zipper each time. It takes 10 tries sometimes before the zipper will engage and sometimes I just give up. The price is not right for something of poor quality. I will be attaching prong snaps to it this week.",2
"Love the fact that I can pump without hands but the zipper is terrible! It takes me almost as long to try to zip it up without the zipper splitting as it does to pump.",2
"Mine worked for 3 months but was a pain because the zipper always got stuck. It finally broke completely the other day, prompting me to write this review.",2
"So far I've bought two of these easy expressions bustier because they keep on breaking. The first one I bought had a faulty zipper that popped after around two months use. The second one has holes in the fabric after around two months use. The product is definitely not made with long term quality in mind.",2
"Cheapest zipper ever! I can't believe this is over $30 with a zipper that breaks almost every time I try to use it. I spend half my lunch break trying to get it on!",2
"So, I got this free with the purchase of a breastpump.\n\nThat was nice.\n\nThe not so nice - it doesn't fit.\n\nThe sizing chart says it should fit but not even close. I'm a 42C, so according to the sizing chart it should fit. Alas, it does not.\n\nI was skeptical about it fitting anyway but it would need another like 3 inches to fit. And Target doesn't even sell the larger size.\n\nOh well, I guess I'll be returning this too.",2
"I'm a small person (34C now that baby has arrived) but the sizing on this bustier is totally off. Though according to the chart on the back I could get a size S, the M I first purchased was too small to zip! I managed to cram myself into it once, but the second time I went to use it the zipper split. I returned it and got a size L, and even it seems slightly strained in the zipper. I would say if you are large-breasted this product is not going to work out very well for you.",2

"bought one white, one pink. First disappointment: pink is a lot darker than shown. Second disappointment I bought my normal DD cup. The Bali Passion for Comfort cup goes all the way UNDER my arm and is loose at the top pf the cup where the lace is before the strap. NO I would NOT buy again.",2
"Very disappointed with this bra. It is not up to Bali standard. Because of the style, the cup starts way up high and I looked droopy...albeit less busty, but it does not have any lift. (I am in a minimizer for a reason.) :) I have always had good luck with Bali. I cannot recommend this bra at all.",2
"Bali bras have always been my go-to for correct sizing--except for this order. I was recently fitted in a store and determined my usual size of 34DD was too small. The bra I ordered, in a 32DDD, however, is far too large in cup size, in comparison to the one I purchased in the store. Should have ordered the 34DD instead, at least for this style bra. All other features are quite nice and I do like the style. Will order different size next time.",2
"I used to buy the bras with the same name a couple of years ago, and I really liked them. I ordered these recently to replace some of my old ones, and they're not the same. The fabric isn't as supportive, and the sizing is a bit off for me. Some may find the new version more comfortable, but I miss the old one. I returned these.",2
"Unfortunately, the bras did not fit as I had hoped. The cups puckered and were wider apart than my body is. My breasts splayed outwards beneath my armpits. Definitely not the look I was going for. I will have to return them.",2
"I have never wore it, it has this extra fabric towards the top going to straps that kinda bunches up and the wires bulge at the arm which is miserable and it is not true to size..It is awful!! I am 5'2 and a true 38DDD. The material is excellent, but the sizing and construction is not right.\nI also ordered the Lilyette Embellished Keyhole Minimizer Bra at the same time, Hands down the best fit ever!!",2
"I'm not crazy about it. I'm still not crazy about it.",2
"It digs into my shoulders. Very it is very uncomfortable.",2
"I will be returning this bra as it just doesn't fit properly. My other Bali purchase in the same size fits perfectly.",2
"I do not particularly like this bra. It is like so many minimizer bras that push the breasts laterally. When I have it on I can actually feel my breasts touching my arms! I was hoping this would replace the great Bali minimizer that has been discontinued - 3642. What a great bra that was. Just lifted the breasts without making them look huge. Please Bali, bring back 3642!!",2
"I bought this bra by default. It was the closest recommendation to what I actually wanted. It's sort of comfortable. But it doesn't minimize anything. It actually created bulges. I don't like it. If I had spent more on it, I would've returned it.",2
"These Bras run small. My size is a 32C and when i arrived it looked like a small girls bra. I ended up giving it to my niece. I would size up abut im worried i will get stuck with another bra that does not fit.",2
"I AM CURRENTLY WEARING THIS SAME BRA BOUGHT IN A STORE. THE BRA I RECEIVED FROM JMS BARELY HOOKED ON THE FIRST HOOKS! I HAVE BOUGHT TWO OTHER BRAS FROM JMS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. ARE THESE SECONDS? I'M NOT RETURNING AS I CAN GET A BRA EXTENDER AND I REALLY LIKE THE STYLE--BUT I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN.",2
"This bra has virtually no support and loses shape rather quickly! I do not recommend this bra to any busty woman like myself. On the plus side the straps and material are very comfortable.",2
"Bra fit nice (44DD) BUT straps were way too tight. Also the sides of the bra created a muffin top in the underarm area. Not very well supported in the under arm area. Cup fit perfect. Had to return 6 of these bras.",2
"I bought 3 of these bras and one underwire in each of them cracked within a 6 month period. The bra was very comfortable, but because of this I won't buy them again.",2
"I wear a 42 D. Nice comfortable bra but straps slide and have to keep shortening them up, as much as I would like to have this bra hold me up, thin straps do not work in this bra. Nice bra though.\nI guess you can't expect miracles from cheap bras.",2
"I buy alot of Bali bras and have always been satisfied with them. However, I was recently measured and found my true size is a 32D, which what I purchased. It made me either bulge in the front or on the sides. Not happy at all with it.",2
"I have slopey shoulders and although I love the support of this bra (and the nice padding to hide the nips), this bra has a big problem if you've got big breasts: The strap adjusters slip like crazy. If you have small shoulders and you need to shorten them, they pretty much slide down to maximum length as soon as you cinch them up. I've had to do the bra-adjustment dance in the ladies room at least four or five times a day because my straps are constantly too long and won't stay adjusted. While I really love how comfortable and supportive this bra is, I will be looking for a new bra simple because of this design defect.",2
"bought one white, one pink. First disappointment: pink is a lot darker than shown. Second disappointment I bought my normal DD cup. The Bali Passion for Comfort cup goes all the way UNDER my arm and is loose at the top pf the cup where the lace is before the strap. NO I would NOT buy again.",2
"Very disappointed with this bra. It is not up to Bali standard. Because of the style, the cup starts way up high and I looked droopy...albeit less busty, but it does not have any lift. (I am in a minimizer for a reason.) :) I have always had good luck with Bali. I cannot recommend this bra at all.",2
"Bali bras have always been my go-to for correct sizing--except for this order. I was recently fitted in a store and determined my usual size of 34DD was too small. The bra I ordered, in a 32DDD, however, is far too large in cup size, in comparison to the one I purchased in the store. Should have ordered the 34DD instead, at least for this style bra. All other features are quite nice and I do like the style. Will order different size next time.",2
"I used to buy the bras with the same name a couple of years ago, and I really liked them. I ordered these recently to replace some of my old ones, and they're not the same. The fabric isn't as supportive, and the sizing is a bit off for me. Some may find the new version more comfortable, but I miss the old one. I returned these.",2
"Unfortunately, the bras did not fit as I had hoped. The cups puckered and were wider apart than my body is. My breasts splayed outwards beneath my armpits. Definitely not the look I was going for. I will have to return them.",2
"I have never wore it, it has this extra fabric towards the top going to straps that kinda bunches up and the wires bulge at the arm which is miserable and it is not true to size..It is awful!! I am 5'2 and a true 38DDD. The material is excellent, but the sizing and construction is not right.\nI also ordered the Lilyette Embellished Keyhole Minimizer Bra at the same time, Hands down the best fit ever!!",2
"I'm not crazy about it. I'm still not crazy about it.",2
"It digs into my shoulders. Very it is very uncomfortable.",2
"I will be returning this bra as it just doesn't fit properly. My other Bali purchase in the same size fits perfectly.",2
"I do not particularly like this bra. It is like so many minimizer bras that push the breasts laterally. When I have it on I can actually feel my breasts touching my arms! I was hoping this would replace the great Bali minimizer that has been discontinued - 3642. What a great bra that was. Just lifted the breasts without making them look huge. Please Bali, bring back 3642!!",2
"I bought this bra by default. It was the closest recommendation to what I actually wanted. It's sort of comfortable. But it doesn't minimize anything. It actually created bulges. I don't like it. If I had spent more on it, I would've returned it.",2
"These Bras run small. My size is a 32C and when i arrived it looked like a small girls bra. I ended up giving it to my niece. I would size up abut im worried i will get stuck with another bra that does not fit.",2

These also have cotton DK cups, no underwire (but no more comfortable) 3 hooks, much wider back (which cuts into my shoulderblades) & straps. Overall, less comfortable, no more supportive or shapely. Also ridiculous that beige only avail mail order, not retail.",2
"I wore these bras for years, switched to a similar JMS style, which is now unavailable, and decided to come back to Bali, well the quality of this bra if definitely not what it used to be; guess I will keep looking.",2
"The band/clasp was too wide and rode up too high on my back. I had hoped to be able to use this bra when running, but it didn't really provide enough support. I was really looking for something to replace my Bali Coolmax Downtime bras which have been discontinued. : ( Sports bras are too confining and difficult to put on and take off. The Bali Coolmax Downtime bras were perfect. Had I known they were going to be discontinued, I'd have purchased a bunch of them!\n\nUnfortunately, this (Bali Cotton Double Support Wirefree) wasn't the bra to to replace them. I'll just have to keep looking.\n\nWould I recommend this to a friend? Depends on what she's looking for in a bra. These are perfectly fine bras; just not for my needs.",2
"I thought the item was padded or lined so that I would not show through but it was not so I sent it back.",2
"I wanted a cotton everyday bra for working out in the yard in the summer. I ordered 3 of these and wish I would have just tried 1 first. I am a 36C and they say it's stretch they mean it, it is so stretchy there isn't any support. Plus the band cuts into my ribs and sides. I am tugging at it after a couple of hours of wearing it and wanting to change out of it.

I was really looking for something to replace my Bali Coolmax Downtime bras which have been discontinued. : ( Sports bras are too confining and difficult to put on and take off. The Bali Coolmax Downtime bras were perfect. Had I known they were going to be discontinued, I'd have purchased a bunch of them!\n\nUnfortunately, this (Bali Cotton Double Support Wirefree) wasn't the bra to to replace them. I'll just have to keep looking.\n\nWould I recommend this to a friend? Depends on what she's looking for in a bra. These are perfectly fine bras; just not for my needs.",2

I am a 36C and they say it's stretch they mean it, it is so stretchy there isn't any support. Plus the band cuts into my ribs and sides.

It may sevice smaller and/or firmer busted women, but did not offer the added support less firm bodies require, from the thin straps to the lightweight fabric. Just disappointing after reading the item details and specific purposes the bra was supposed to address. I am planning to send it back.",2
"There is not adequate side and back support so bulges just stick out all over the place. My upper body is not that oversized, but I wanted a firmer fit under more clingy clothes. This bra does not do it for me. It fits like a poorly crafted sports bra with no support. I'll keep it, but only for weekend, stay in the house and get sweaty work - not for going out.",2

If only the straps would have been a little wider and a little longer this would have been that bra.",2
"I've been buying Hanes cotton underwear for years. They were always very comfortable and made of a smooth cotton. Last year all of my purchases were not the same quality cotton. Some of the styles were of a harder material and very uncomfortable and even shrunk after 1 wash so, they couldn't be worn.\n\nThey come in packs of 3 and I had some packs where only 1 of them was made out of the smooth comfortable cotton and the others were stiff.\n\nI noticed in the reviews other women are finding the quality issues with Hanes as well. I hope Hanes get a better cotton supplier and manufacture and quality control because as of now, they're uneven and you can't count on every pair in the pack of 3 being a good value and quality.",2

"My husband has worn Hanes men's underwear for years, so I decided to give the women's panties a try. They are very comfortable and cute, but when I washed them, the elastic waistband on every single pair began to unravel.

It was the right size but I could not wear them. Not a happy customer.",2

With lDD size, obviously bra needs strength but it is skimpy on comfort.\nShoulder straps need cushioning, under arms need to be wider to avoid 'side boobs' snd hooks need protective padding lonhger.",2

I got some in a beautiful blue/purple and so e in an UGLY orange! Who wears orange panties??? The quality is questionavle but big girls do t have a lot of reasonably priced choices.",2
"My main disappointment comes from the fact that these are not true briefs but much closer to hip huggers. This is the second time I have ordered them and was so hoping JMS had gone back to their classic briefs which I loved for many years, alas they did not. The other disappointment is that there is no way to select the color or pattern you want, you take whatever color they send you. I do like that the elastic leg openings are fabric covered but I won't be ordering again because the cut / fit is not what I want. I want full briefs!",2
"Bought two weeks ago. Wore two times and the elastic came apart. Had purchased before and was really pleased but these where a disappointment",2
"These run a lot smaller than they used to. I bought a size 10 before and they fit, but I wanted a little more room, so I bought a size 11. The size 11 is at least 2 sizes smaller than my 10's are. I wished I had read the other reviews closer before I purchased them. Its not worth the postage to send them back.",2
"I've been hunting for panties made in the old style/shape where the side seam is on the side and the front covers from my waist to my crotch. The picture looks like it does but neither is the case. Also thought the 5pack might be a fuller fit. This brand runs smaller than JMS. When will designers learn that not all full size women carry their weight in the rear? We need full and long fronts. Panies are meant to cover not have the leg hole opening reach almost to the navel.",2
"So on the picture it shows clearly there is yellow and purple- that is not the case. There is no yellow and purple but instead a gray and light pink in it's place. Also the fit is like that of men's underwear. It's a bit odd and uncomfortable but you can't really argue with the price.",2
"Not comfortable. Not good shaping. It was like I wasn't wearing a bra. No support at all.",2
"I ordered by the size the chart said I should get. It was a tight fit, which was fine with me. I still didn't get the support that I get in my regular bra. Sorry I couldn't have given a better review.",2

This bra was too small overall, even though I used the size chart to order my size - 2X which is supposed to fit a 44DD. My breasts did a muffin top over the edges of fabric and it was too tight all around. I was very dissapointed.",2
"This bra is very pretty, but not nearly as comfortable as the other Comfort Revolution bra with the thin foam lining. I would not purchase this style again.",2
"I purchased four of these bras in XL. I tried on one and it was like I had no bra on. There was no type of lift b/c the straps are like spandex. I purchased the bras mainly to workout in but wearing these and running would be uncomfortable since my chest would be moving everywhere. I will be returning the other three. I will use the one as a sleep in bra only.",2
"I do not like this bra at all, it bunches up under the girls, and the straps don't stay flat, they bunch up too. I would never wear this out in public, it is Ok at home. Also the band is to small for my size, I like the bands that have 4 hooks, this only has 2?\nNot happy at all, and won't buy anymore.",2
"I had big hopes for this bra but I'm just too large for it I guess as I not only didn't get any support what so ever, I couldn't keep the straps up at all. I spent half the day tugging at the straps. I would much rather have had a slip on bra, no hooks in the back, and adjustable straps. I honestly think for someone that is smaller, it would be a wonderful fit, just not me. It just seems like \",2
"my complaint is with the man-made fabric in this bra. I have had this trouble with other underwear made from this sort of fabric. First, it shrinks when washed---even in cold water ; it has an SMELL that gets worse as your body heat up the fabric. This is very anoying to me; last it breaks my skin out in itchy rash. I find this to be true with almost any man-made fibers. I returned the bra. ONEHANESPLACE is very nice about any problem you have with the products, I love shopping there. Better than the Dept.

"LOVES: I LOVE the fact that I can have a little 'chill' in the midst of an Arizona summer. The TheraPearl pack feels amazing giving relief of the basic discomforts of pregnancy and also relief from the heat. I also like the fabric of the Bobby Tummy Support Band. It is thin, soft and stretchy.The support it gives is great as well. \nPROBLEMS: I typically wear size 12 and I have a M/L....with my 28 week pregnant belly it is very tight and almost doesn't fit.I assumed it would fit quite well being that it was a size L which is what I wear (non-pregnant and pregnant). The velcro was also bothersome but I think if I was wearing a larger size it wouldn't be as much of a hindrance/annoyance. \nOVERALL: I rate this product 3 stars! I don't typically indulge in things just for comfort. This product, for me, is purely comfort and I truly enjoy the chill I can have on my lower back during this 'pregnant summer'. It is definitely something that will be able to withstand years of use. I will continue to use it even after I have my baby! \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",3
"Im 3 months pregs and my top button is no longer cooperating on any of my bottoms. I liked the extender for my work pants but the sheild that comes with it was awkward and bulky so i didnt us it, ill just have to wear looser shirts for now. The extender with the button (for jeans) was a LIFE SAVER but again the sheild was bothersome. Its my first pregnancy so if theres a better alternative, i have no clue, but im just happy that i wont lose my pants on the subway now.",3
"The set comes with three different colored panels, which tuck inside the pant to prevent underwear from showing, which is helpful, but I find it impossible to keep the panel from bunching. I wear a modesty panel over top of the belt/panel to avoid my open zipper showing. It's also nice that the set comes with two sizes of each belt- one with a button for jeans, the other with a hook for dress pants. Overall, this set is ok if you don't mind the bunching of the panel and are able to couple with a sheath or panel to avoid the open zipper look.",3
"I have used this product several times. I feel like at first it worked really well but the elastic where the button is has stretched out. I'm not very big for 26 weeks. I'm still in my pre-pregnancy pants and I used this product on the smallest setting. But because the elastic stretched out it is too big and my pants fall now. I resorted to using a hair elastic instead. When I get bigger it might work well but for now I can't use it. Love the idea, not the material. Oh and the fabric that comes with it is useless. At least for me.",3
"This was great to make the waist in pants, capris, jeans, etc. wider before you are ready for maternities. Makes your budget go a lot farther, and you feel better, too. The cloth you attach to the belt is a waste as it just gets bunched up (which is why I just gave 3 stars), but the belt by itself with long tops works great! It stretches your wardrobe as you can still wear many pre-maternities!",3
"I bought the belly belt kit because I am a few months pregnant. It does help lengthen my waistbands and is pretty comfortable. However, the colored inserts don't work, so you have to just leave your zipper down. Also, the clasp fastener for more dressy pants doesn't work as my dress pants all have two clasps, not one. I think this product is pretty expensive for what it ends up offering. Personally, I have found bella bands to be more helpful. I",3
"I ordered these to try to get a little more mileage out of my pre-pregnancy jeans. They do ok. The panel things I ended up not using as they bunch up. The bands are very stretchy, perhaps a little stretchier than I would have liked. If you are wearing a long shirt these work well, but I was always checking my fly because it was unzipped and showed with shorter shirts. All in all a decent buy. They bought me a few weeks. I've since given up and bought the full-panel pants as they simply are more comfortable.",3
"I work in an office and have tons of pants that close with a slide fastener. However, the slide fastener that comes with the kit doesn't fit any of my pants. The button extender works great though!",3
"I was so excited to get this \",3
"This concept is excellent, but the execution is weird. I want to keep wearing my favorite jeans as long as I can while pregnant (working on my 5th month now), and have been able to because of this product, but in my mind, you're paying for a lot of pieces you won't use. For example, the modesty panels are kind of ridiculous. If someone could see my modesty panel, I've failed at dressing myself... so why give us three different colors? Plus they're too bulky to wear with the smallest band (can't speak for the larger bands yet). Also, unless you're wearing a shirt that completely skims away from your body at the waist, you can see weird things going on with the top of your pants under your shirt, requiring you to wear something to \",3
"Although I read in a previous that this was not meant for curvy women, I purchased it anyways. It bends at the waist and creates a bulge which in turn looks horrible. I purchased the correct size (as per website) along with the belly bandit binder (used underneath the belly bandit itself) and it fits fine once I stand up, the issue is once you sit and then stand. Unfortunately I would not recommend spending so much money on a similar product that can be purchased elsewhere for half the cost.",3
"I recently purchased the BelleShield and Bamboo Bandit and have to say that although the product works well, it is of poor quality. I have worn the shield and bandit itself a total of 7 times and the shield has torn at the seams where the clasps are (not due to the size I ordered, I promise). The wrap itself is also too long for my torso and bends under my clothes, and unless you wear a loose top, it is clearly visible under clothes. With this being said, the product DOES work, I just wish it was a little higher quality.",3

The rolling made wearing it very uncomfortable because it would pinch my abdominal area pretty badly.",3
"I bought the Belly Bandit about 2 months ago. I bought two, size M and S. I wore the M for the first two weeks, and then I ended up buying a size S. I wore it for 5 weeks. I think it helped. Im back to my pre-pregnancy weight, but I still have some toning to do in my abdominal area. I didn't like the fabric. I was hard, and after wearing the Bandit day and night I was ready to get rid of it. The Bandit folds and irritated my skin. So I ended up wearing it over a tank top. I would recommend this product because I am back to wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes, but it is uncomfortable.",3

"I really like this at first but as you continue to wear it, it's wrinkles start to dig in and begin to get uncomfortable. It probably works really well if you don't have \",3
"I purchased mine after having my baby. I received it about a week after having the baby and wore it all the time. It tightened my tummy but it started rolling on the sides pretty badly. I had to take it off and fold it to try to get it to regain it's shape. I even wore it upside down at times. The rolling made wearing it very uncomfortable because it would pinch my abdominal area pretty badly.",3
"I bought the Belly Bandit about 2 months ago. I bought two, size M and S. I wore the M for the first two weeks, and then I ended up buying a size S. I wore it for 5 weeks. I think it helped. Im back to my pre-pregnancy weight, but I still have some toning to do in my abdominal area. I didn't like the fabric. I was hard, and after wearing the Bandit day and night I was ready to get rid of it. The Bandit folds and irritated my skin. So I ended up wearing it over a tank top. I would recommend this product because I am back to wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes, but it is uncomfortable.",3
"it is a very cute shirt, long enough to wear with leggings. it is tight around the armpit area for some reason, so that's a little uncomfortable.",3
"This is a perfectly functional cardigan. Beware, I ordered the olive green online and when I came its a pretty dull color. Its not as vibrant of an olive as I hoped. It was almost brown.",3
"This is a nice shirt and I love the popover concept, but you can see thru it. I am a small, but I still don't want people seeing my stomach. It would be nice under a sweater",3
"Do not pit this shirt in dryer ever! Hung to dry then tossed in dryer just a few minutes to de-wrinkle and it shrunk a whole size or more. I would love to have a new one, looked great on me!",3
"Bough this in a size M and L and typically wear a size 10 or medium. I'm an athletic build with a bubble-butt. The medium fit me fine except it was snug in the crotch and a little more low-rise than I wanted. Size large had a higher rise, but looser and longer legs. Not sure which I'm keeping. The print varies, so you may have the vertical stripes in places where it doesn't necessarily slims you.",3
"This isn't junior sizing it's womens. I am 7mos pregnant and although this is not maternity I ordered it. I was 167lbs prior to pregnancy and now at 7mos prego I'm 197...the XL is big on me now...will try L and repost results.",3
"Awesome design and material is super soft. The material is pretty thin and see-through, so I'll probably need to wear another tank underneath. It also runs at least one size larger. I'm 5'3\",3
"Love the design and colors, but it is very large and I am a large girl!!",3
"LOVES: I LOVE the fact that I can have a little 'chill' in the midst of an Arizona summer. The TheraPearl pack feels amazing giving relief of the basic discomforts of pregnancy and also relief from the heat. I also like the fabric of the Bobby Tummy Support Band. It is thin, soft and stretchy.The support it gives is great as well. \nPROBLEMS: I typically wear size 12 and I have a M/L....with my 28 week pregnant belly it is very tight and almost doesn't fit.I assumed it would fit quite well being that it was a size L which is what I wear (non-pregnant and pregnant). The velcro was also bothersome but I think if I was wearing a larger size it wouldn't be as much of a hindrance/annoyance. \nOVERALL: I rate this product 3 stars! I don't typically indulge in things just for comfort. This product, for me, is purely comfort and I truly enjoy the chill I can have on my lower back during this 'pregnant summer'. It is definitely something that will be able to withstand years of use. I will continue to use it even after I have my baby! \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",3
"Since I live an hour from the nearest clothes stores, it's much easier to order online, and my previous maternity clothes have fit fantastic. These are the pants I would say have fit the least. While the waist fits perfect and is really comfortable, it's almost too tight to put on around my calves and ankles. I wear a small in everything, so I was really surprised when these didn't fit. I kept them though because if I went up a size the waist would be too big. I would recommend these to women with really small legs.",3
"I was hoping these would fit like maternity leggings at the top, and ponte knit pants through the leg down to the ankle. Instead, they just fit a bit weird. I have the Liz Lange Maternity Knit Leggings in a Small (prepregnancy size XS or S), and they're getting a little tight on my 17-wks-prego-with-twins frame. I was hoping by ordering a M in these, it would solve the tightness and be a little warmer during the cold winter. I'm 5' 6\",3
"Great style tank, but the black color runs smaller than the green and pink (which is really orange, not pink). Love the style of this tank and overall quality, but concerned the Med, which fits me now @ 6 months pregnant will not fit throughout my pregnancy. I own the green and orange, which are longer by a few inches and have much more stretch to them. I am going to return and see if the large is any longer and has a better fit (more stretch to it).",3
"I'm glad I got these on clearance. I don't know if they're really worth the original price.\n\nThe good:\nThey were plenty long for me. This is tricky to find, especially in maternity clothing, as I am 5'8\",3
"I wanted to love these but they were just too big.  I can wear them but they are constantly falling down.  I wore pants size 6 prior to getting pregnant.",3
"I bought these in M/L.  Pre-pregnancy I'm a pear-shaped 10.  These fit great through the leg, thigh, and rear, but the belly is very big, even at 24 weeks.  I usually fold it down.  That being said, they are crazy comfortable!  I wear them around the house a lot and they go well with a tunic top for work or going out.  Know that the seat/crotch gets sheer when worn!  They are NOT seamless- there's seams down the inside of the legs. If you're super picky, get something else.  If you want to be comfy without much pressure on your belly, get these!",3
"I bought 2 and one arrived with the clip upside down. I have to take it apart and resew it to use it. The other tank is awesome.",3
"I bought these tights to wear throughout my pregnancy, but they were only really useful when I was in my third trimester. Other than that, they fall down. There is not enough spandex in the material to have it cling to your belly and hold them up. I ended up having to wear my belly band OVER the top, defeating the purpose of a comfy tight.",3
"I'm looking for a thicker legging.. just wasn't impressed with these for the price, returned.",3
"I'm glad i read the reviews first before ordering, because they do run very small. I ordered two sizes up, and they fit fine. They feel comfortable, but they are only good for sleeping in and nothing more.",3
"These bras serve their purpose, I can nurse in them. The band around the bottom isn't very comfortable. My biggest complaint is how high the back of the bras come up my neck, it stops about 2 or so inches below my hairline. This drives me crazy.",3
"I like the length of these and they're great to wear with boots, but the seam between the back of the pants and the panel feels a little low and hits me in an uncomfortable spot. It makes it feel like my pants are constantly falling down.",3

"Was looking forward to having some good support, however the extra and thick padding in the cup makes the bra feel somewhat uncomfortable for a mother with a larger bust. It's also not as supportive as the description suggests.",3
"Returned this bra--only one that in XL seemed a wee bit big on me. Padding was overkill--but maybe perfect for someone not a 40DD. Straps were puny and didn't provide enough support.",3
"I bought 2 and one arrived with the clip upside down. I have to take it apart and resew it to use it. The other tank is awesome.",3
"Love the idea... It does work, it's soft and stays put. But for $30 you think they'd put a more durable zipper on it for someone to take on & off 3 times a day. It has only been 3 months! It's not like I'm abusing the thing and I'm not a large woman.",3
"I love the concept of this bra! It is quite hard to get on when you are alone. I have to hold the top part with my teeth in order to zip it up. Or, I have to zip it then put it over my head. The zipper is of poor quality and gives me a lot of trouble. I wear a size 34C bra and a medium wouldn't even come close to closing, so the size chart was way off for me. But, when this bra does work it is amazing!!!!! I doubt this bra is going to last a full year of pumping, but I will buy another one because it is amazing when it does work.",3
"I purchased a large and went according to the size chart. It's a little large for me. Also I don't have a Medela breast pump and thought that it would still work with my breast pump which it would if I had purchased a medium. [...]",3
"This product is just ok. It does it's job however don't fall asleep while using if you move just a little it will loose suction and get milk everywhere. Good for sitting up strait doing work not relaxing In a chair.",3
"As other reviews say, this runs small. I was at the upper end of Small on the size chart, and the Medium ended up being pretty snug. The bottom of the zipper needs to be coaxed to align...it seems like it won't hold up over time. That being said, this item does the job...it's nice to be able to pump hands-free!",3
"I'm a 36C in my nursing bras and SHOULD wear a medium according to the size chart. It was way too small! The zipper is also a really bad design for something that needs to fit tightly, and should have bra snaps on the front instead. The material is really nice despite the design flaws.",3
"I bought this product because I wanted to be hands free and I didn't bother shopping around for other options. It works, but is a huge pain to change into every time you want to pump (especially in the middle of the night). Also, the zipper nearly broke within the first 10 wears and I spent half an hour in the middle of the night trying to fix it. There are much better options out there that are more functional, more comfortable, and higher quality. I now use the Rumina Pumping Bra, which double as a nursing bra. MUCH MUCH better option. AND it can be worn as a regular bra for convenience of pumping at work, etc.",3
"I'll look for a different one next time. I'm really busty and it seems to stretch out some. If I don't zip it just right the zipper pops at the bottom. It's kind of hard to get on with the front zipper.",3
"This was a great relief. Allowed me to perform various tasks while pumping and prevents tiring from holding the pumping apparatus in place. However after 4 months of use, the zipper broke and I am now shopping for another bustier. I used it a lot as I pump exclusively, 4-5 times a day but I think it could be more studier than that. It is also a little on the costly side.",3
"I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant and bought this bra to wear at night and to nurse when the baby is born. While this bra is made of a soft, super stretching material it makes my breasts itch like crazy whenever I have it on. I feel it doesn't offer any shape to my breasts like the photo shows but since I will just be wearing it at night once my baby arrives it should be ok, as long as I can stop itching in it!",3
"The leggings are actually really nice quality, meaning they are thick enough that they aren't completely see through. They have a sheen feel to them as well, which makes it easy to wear under tunics without having the tunic ride up every time you walk. The unfortunate thing is that they slide down constantly. Maybe because I am on 13 weeks, but I find that the crotch area constantly slides down and looks like I am wearing drop crotch pants. Unfortunately these are the nicest leggings I have found so far, so I am dealing with it - it's not a deal breaker but just super annoying!",3
"I love the Bravado Bodysilk bra, so I tried this one for a more \",3
"It looks nice and the material is nice, but it's very small. Try to go into a store or order at least 1 size bigger than you normally wear, so 2 for when your milk comes in.",3
"I'm one of those crazy women that like to just pump one side at a time (I have one side that produces more than the other...almost double sometimes!) and with this bra I do cut my pumping time in half and can pump more efficiently and drain the breast. My only gripe is that I find it sometimes cumbersome and difficult to use so I don't bother. I'd rather just get straight to pumping instead of having to fumble around with the zipper and trying to hold the flanges in place. Also, I'd rather just carry and clean one set of pump parts instead of two. The bra itself is good and the material is thick.",3
"It worked fine until a little after 8 months the velcro completely stopped working. Its totally useless now. I even tried fixing on velcro stickies but that didn't work. I used it multiple times a day so it had a good run. If I were to buy one again I would buy something with an actual bra strap instead of the velcro. I don't know why everyone loves this bra, maybe they didn't use it as much as me and wear it out.",3
"I thought this bra would be a game changer for me while pumping. Turns out, it was more of a hassle to get it on and zipped and the pump in the right place. But once you got it all positioned correctly, it was nice to be mobile or hands free to do other things. Overall though, i'd say skip this.",3
"nipple openings are very close together. adjustment options were not sufficient to line them up for use so it was returned",3

Straps nice & supportive but not $50 amazing. 40DD and in my 1st month breastfeeding, so not much has been comfortable so far!",3

I also have a slightly large waist and chest for my size, and the dress really squeezed my top section.\nI really liked this dress, which is really cute; unfortunately, it did not fit my body type, so I had to return it.",3
"Fit runs small. The crocheted lace looks pretty but is very rough. The inner dress or cami hugs the body, and the outer crocheted (see through) layer is the fit and flare. I ordered other dresses this size from target that fit great, I guess this one I need to try the next size up. I didn't zoom in on the picture when purchasing so I didn't notice that it's a buttoned dress in the front.",3

"The price is right for the skirt and the fit is true to size. I wear size 28 in Miss Me and a size 6 fits fine in this skirt. I would give it a 5 star review if the material was slightly thicker. Since it comes in white, it's a bit transparent. I don't think I'll be keeping this and will sadly return it.",3

It is tough ordering this bathing suit because it is only online... big bummer. Very cute and good quality though... the fabric felt so smooth and soft!",3

The extender with the button (for jeans) was a LIFE SAVER but again the sheild was bothersome. Its my first pregnancy so if theres a better alternative, i have no clue, but im just happy that i wont lose my pants on the subway now.",3
"The set comes with three different colored panels, which tuck inside the pant to prevent underwear from showing, which is helpful, but I find it impossible to keep the panel from bunching. I wear a modesty panel over top of the belt/panel to avoid my open zipper showing. It's also nice that the set comes with two sizes of each belt- one with a button for jeans, the other with a hook for dress pants. Overall, this set is ok if you don't mind the bunching of the panel and are able to couple with a sheath or panel to avoid the open zipper look.",3
"I have used this product several times. I feel like at first it worked really well but the elastic where the button is has stretched out. I'm not very big for 26 weeks. I'm still in my pre-pregnancy pants and I used this product on the smallest setting. But because the elastic stretched out it is too big and my pants fall now. I resorted to using a hair elastic instead. When I get bigger it might work well but for now I can't use it. Love the idea, not the material. Oh and the fabric that comes with it is useless. At least for me.",3
"This was great to make the waist in pants, capris, jeans, etc. wider before you are ready for maternities. Makes your budget go a lot farther, and you feel better, too. The cloth you attach to the belt is a waste as it just gets bunched up (which is why I just gave 3 stars), but the belt by itself with long tops works great! It stretches your wardrobe as you can still wear many pre-maternities!",3
"I bought the belly belt kit because I am a few months pregnant. It does help lengthen my waistbands and is pretty comfortable. However, the colored inserts don't work, so you have to just leave your zipper down. Also, the clasp fastener for more dressy pants doesn't work as my dress pants all have two clasps, not one. I think this product is pretty expensive for what it ends up offering. Personally, I have found bella bands to be more helpful. I",3
"I ordered these to try to get a little more mileage out of my pre-pregnancy jeans. They do ok. The panel things I ended up not using as they bunch up. The bands are very stretchy, perhaps a little stretchier than I would have liked. If you are wearing a long shirt these work well, but I was always checking my fly because it was unzipped and showed with shorter shirts. All in all a decent buy. They bought me a few weeks. I've since given up and bought the full-panel pants as they simply are more comfortable.",3

"This concept is excellent, but the execution is weird. I want to keep wearing my favorite jeans as long as I can while pregnant (working on my 5th month now), and have been able to because of this product, but in my mind, you're paying for a lot of pieces you won't use. For example, the modesty panels are kind of ridiculous. If someone could see my modesty panel, I've failed at dressing myself... so why give us three different colors? Plus they're too bulky to wear with the smallest band (can't speak for the larger bands yet). Also, unless you're wearing a shirt that completely skims away from your body at the waist, you can see weird things going on with the top of your pants under your shirt, requiring you to wear something to \",3
"Although I read in a previous that this was not meant for curvy women, I purchased it anyways. It bends at the waist and creates a bulge which in turn looks horrible. I purchased the correct size (as per website) along with the belly bandit binder (used underneath the belly bandit itself) and it fits fine once I stand up, the issue is once you sit and then stand. Unfortunately I would not recommend spending so much money on a similar product that can be purchased elsewhere for half the cost.",3
"I recently purchased the BelleShield and Bamboo Bandit and have to say that although the product works well, it is of poor quality. I have worn the shield and bandit itself a total of 7 times and the shield has torn at the seams where the clasps are (not due to the size I ordered, I promise). The wrap itself is also too long for my torso and bends under my clothes, and unless you wear a loose top, it is clearly visible under clothes. With this being said, the product DOES work, I just wish it was a little higher quality.",3

I had to take it off and fold it to try to get it to regain it's shape. I even wore it upside down at times. The rolling made wearing it very uncomfortable because it would pinch my abdominal area pretty badly.",3
"I bought the Belly Bandit about 2 months ago. I bought two, size M and S. I wore the M for the first two weeks, and then I ended up buying a size S. I wore it for 5 weeks. I think it helped. Im back to my pre-pregnancy weight, but I still have some toning to do in my abdominal area. I didn't like the fabric. I was hard, and after wearing the Bandit day and night I was ready to get rid of it. The Bandit folds and irritated my skin. So I ended up wearing it over a tank top. I would recommend this product because I am back to wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes, but it is uncomfortable.",3
"Bough this in a size M and L and typically wear a size 10 or medium. I'm an athletic build with a bubble-butt. The medium fit me fine except it was snug in the crotch and a little more low-rise than I wanted. Size large had a higher rise, but looser and longer legs. Not sure which I'm keeping. The print varies, so you may have the vertical stripes in places where it doesn't necessarily slims you.",3

"Since I live an hour from the nearest clothes stores, it's much easier to order online, and my previous maternity clothes have fit fantastic. These are the pants I would say have fit the least. While the waist fits perfect and is really comfortable, it's almost too tight to put on around my calves and ankles. I wear a small in everything, so I was really surprised when these didn't fit. I kept them though because if I went up a size the waist would be too big. I would recommend these to women with really small legs.",3
"I was hoping these would fit like maternity leggings at the top, and ponte knit pants through the leg down to the ankle. Instead, they just fit a bit weird. I have the Liz Lange Maternity Knit Leggings in a Small (prepregnancy size XS or S), and they're getting a little tight on my 17-wks-prego-with-twins frame. I was hoping by ordering a M in these, it would solve the tightness and be a little warmer during the cold winter. I'm 5' 6\",3
"Great style tank, but the black color runs smaller than the green and pink (which is really orange, not pink). Love the style of this tank and overall quality, but concerned the Med, which fits me now @ 6 months pregnant will not fit throughout my pregnancy. I own the green and orange, which are longer by a few inches and have much more stretch to them. I am going to return and see if the large is any longer and has a better fit (more stretch to it).",3

That being said, they are crazy comfortable!  I wear them around the house a lot and they go well with a tunic top for work or going out.  Know that the seat/crotch gets sheer when worn!  They are NOT seamless- there's seams down the inside of the legs. If you're super picky, get something else.  If you want to be comfy without much pressure on your belly, get these!",3

"I bought these tights to wear throughout my pregnancy, but they were only really useful when I was in my third trimester. Other than that, they fall down. There is not enough spandex in the material to have it cling to your belly and hold them up. I ended up having to wear my belly band OVER the top, defeating the purpose of a comfy tight.",3
"I'm looking for a thicker legging.. just wasn't impressed with these for the price, returned.",3

"I love the concept of this bra! It is quite hard to get on when you are alone. I have to hold the top part with my teeth in order to zip it up. Or, I have to zip it then put it over my head. The zipper is of poor quality and gives me a lot of trouble. I wear a size 34C bra and a medium wouldn't even come close to closing, so the size chart was way off for me. But, when this bra does work it is amazing!!!!! I doubt this bra is going to last a full year of pumping, but I will buy another one because it is amazing when it does work.",3
"I purchased a large and went according to the size chart. It's a little large for me. Also I don't have a Medela breast pump and thought that it would still work with my breast pump which it would if I had purchased a medium. [...]",3
"This product is just ok. It does it's job however don't fall asleep while using if you move just a little it will loose suction and get milk everywhere. Good for sitting up strait doing work not relaxing In a chair.",3
"As other reviews say, this runs small. I was at the upper end of Small on the size chart, and the Medium ended up being pretty snug. The bottom of the zipper needs to be coaxed to align...it seems like it won't hold up over time. That being said, this item does the job...it's nice to be able to pump hands-free!",3
"I'm a 36C in my nursing bras and SHOULD wear a medium according to the size chart. It was way too small! The zipper is also a really bad design for something that needs to fit tightly, and should have bra snaps on the front instead. The material is really nice despite the design flaws.",3
"I bought this product because I wanted to be hands free and I didn't bother shopping around for other options. It works, but is a huge pain to change into every time you want to pump (especially in the middle of the night). Also, the zipper nearly broke within the first 10 wears and I spent half an hour in the middle of the night trying to fix it. There are much better options out there that are more functional, more comfortable, and higher quality. I now use the Rumina Pumping Bra, which double as a nursing bra. MUCH MUCH better option. AND it can be worn as a regular bra for convenience of pumping at work, etc.",3
"I'll look for a different one next time. I'm really busty and it seems to stretch out some. If I don't zip it just right the zipper pops at the bottom. It's kind of hard to get on with the front zipper.",3
"This was a great relief. Allowed me to perform various tasks while pumping and prevents tiring from holding the pumping apparatus in place. However after 4 months of use, the zipper broke and I am now shopping for another bustier. I used it a lot as I pump exclusively, 4-5 times a day but I think it could be more studier than that. It is also a little on the costly side.",3
"I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant and bought this bra to wear at night and to nurse when the baby is born. While this bra is made of a soft, super stretching material it makes my breasts itch like crazy whenever I have it on. I feel it doesn't offer any shape to my breasts like the photo shows but since I will just be wearing it at night once my baby arrives it should be ok, as long as I can stop itching in it!",3
"The leggings are actually really nice quality, meaning they are thick enough that they aren't completely see through. They have a sheen feel to them as well, which makes it easy to wear under tunics without having the tunic ride up every time you walk. The unfortunate thing is that they slide down constantly. Maybe because I am on 13 weeks, but I find that the crotch area constantly slides down and looks like I am wearing drop crotch pants. Unfortunately these are the nicest leggings I have found so far, so I am dealing with it - it's not a deal breaker but just super annoying!",3
"I love the Bravado Bodysilk bra, so I tried this one for a more \",3
"It looks nice and the material is nice, but it's very small. Try to go into a store or order at least 1 size bigger than you normally wear, so 2 for when your milk comes in.",3
"I'm one of those crazy women that like to just pump one side at a time (I have one side that produces more than the other...almost double sometimes!) and with this bra I do cut my pumping time in half and can pump more efficiently and drain the breast. My only gripe is that I find it sometimes cumbersome and difficult to use so I don't bother. I'd rather just get straight to pumping instead of having to fumble around with the zipper and trying to hold the flanges in place. Also, I'd rather just carry and clean one set of pump parts instead of two. The bra itself is good and the material is thick.",3
"It worked fine until a little after 8 months the velcro completely stopped working. Its totally useless now. I even tried fixing on velcro stickies but that didn't work. I used it multiple times a day so it had a good run. If I were to buy one again I would buy something with an actual bra strap instead of the velcro. I don't know why everyone loves this bra, maybe they didn't use it as much as me and wear it out.",3
"I thought this bra would be a game changer for me while pumping. Turns out, it was more of a hassle to get it on and zipped and the pump in the right place. But once you got it all positioned correctly, it was nice to be mobile or hands free to do other things. Overall though, i'd say skip this.",3

"I'm a 36C in my nursing bras and SHOULD wear a medium according to the size chart. It was way too small! The zipper is also a really bad design for something that needs to fit tightly, and should have bra snaps on the front instead. The material is really nice despite the design flaws.",3
"I bought this product because I wanted to be hands free and I didn't bother shopping around for other options. It works, but is a huge pain to change into every time you want to pump (especially in the middle of the night). Also, the zipper nearly broke within the first 10 wears and I spent half an hour in the middle of the night trying to fix it. There are much better options out there that are more functional, more comfortable, and higher quality. I now use the Rumina Pumping Bra, which double as a nursing bra. MUCH MUCH better option. AND it can be worn as a regular bra for convenience of pumping at work, etc.",3
"I'll look for a different one next time. I'm really busty and it seems to stretch out some. If I don't zip it just right the zipper pops at the bottom. It's kind of hard to get on with the front zipper.",3
"This was a great relief. Allowed me to perform various tasks while pumping and prevents tiring from holding the pumping apparatus in place. However after 4 months of use, the zipper broke and I am now shopping for another bustier. I used it a lot as I pump exclusively, 4-5 times a day but I think it could be more studier than that. It is also a little on the costly side.",3
"I'm one of those crazy women that like to just pump one side at a time (I have one side that produces more than the other...almost double sometimes!) and with this bra I do cut my pumping time in half and can pump more efficiently and drain the breast. My only gripe is that I find it sometimes cumbersome and difficult to use so I don't bother. I'd rather just get straight to pumping instead of having to fumble around with the zipper and trying to hold the flanges in place. Also, I'd rather just carry and clean one set of pump parts instead of two. The bra itself is good and the material is thick.",3
"It worked fine until a little after 8 months the velcro completely stopped working. Its totally useless now. I even tried fixing on velcro stickies but that didn't work. I used it multiple times a day so it had a good run. If I were to buy one again I would buy something with an actual bra strap instead of the velcro. I don't know why everyone loves this bra, maybe they didn't use it as much as me and wear it out.",3
"I thought this bra would be a game changer for me while pumping. Turns out, it was more of a hassle to get it on and zipped and the pump in the right place. But once you got it all positioned correctly, it was nice to be mobile or hands free to do other things. Overall though, i'd say skip this.",3
"nipple openings are very close together. adjustment options were not sufficient to line them up for use so it was returned",3
"I returned it. Couldn't justify the cost. Comfortable but not the best bra ever. The removable pads were a joke--how they would ever stay in the right place without being visible circles through the cups is a mystery. Straps nice & supportive but not $50 amazing. 40DD and in my 1st month breastfeeding, so not much has been comfortable so far!",3

"Great concept however not made for curvy women with hips. When i sit down it shifts up and pushes up under my boobs. It only fits well when I'm standing up or lying down. Curvy women are better off with a compression band that feels more like shape wear i.e. flexible/movable/breathable. I found a different band that fits better around my hips and waist.",3
"I really like this at first but as you continue to wear it, it's wrinkles start to dig in and begin to get uncomfortable. It probably works really well if you don't have \",3
"I purchased mine after having my baby. I received it about a week after having the baby and wore it all the time. It tightened my tummy but it started rolling on the sides pretty badly. I had to take it off and fold it to try to get it to regain it's shape. I even wore it upside down at times. The rolling made wearing it very uncomfortable because it would pinch my abdominal area pretty badly.",3
"I bought the Belly Bandit about 2 months ago. I bought two, size M and S. I wore the M for the first two weeks, and then I ended up buying a size S. I wore it for 5 weeks. I think it helped. Im back to my pre-pregnancy weight, but I still have some toning to do in my abdominal area. I didn't like the fabric. I was hard, and after wearing the Bandit day and night I was ready to get rid of it. The Bandit folds and irritated my skin. So I ended up wearing it over a tank top. I would recommend this product because I am back to wearing my pre-pregnancy clothes, but it is uncomfortable.",3

"Since I live an hour from the nearest clothes stores, it's much easier to order online, and my previous maternity clothes have fit fantastic. These are the pants I would say have fit the least. While the waist fits perfect and is really comfortable, it's almost too tight to put on around my calves and ankles. I wear a small in everything, so I was really surprised when these didn't fit. I kept them though because if I went up a size the waist would be too big. I would recommend these to women with really small legs.",3
"I was hoping these would fit like maternity leggings at the top, and ponte knit pants through the leg down to the ankle. Instead, they just fit a bit weird. I have the Liz Lange Maternity Knit Leggings in a Small (prepregnancy size XS or S), and they're getting a little tight on my 17-wks-prego-with-twins frame. I was hoping by ordering a M in these, it would solve the tightness and be a little warmer during the cold winter. I'm 5' 6\",3
"I wore these during my first pregnancy. Was about to order 2 more pair for my current pregnancy when I noticed the Prop 65 warning, which means it contains chemicals that cause cancer or birth defects, or other reproductive harm. (I hope this only means if ingested :) Anyways... I'll probably look for some that don't have this warning.",3
"I am 27.5 weeks pregnant. When I first wore these 2 weeks ago, they felt really comfortable. This week, I felt like I had to keep pulling them up because they would almost fall off my hip. It may be that I just don't like the low waistband or I got the wrong size. For reference, I am 5' 7\",3
"I was expecting something more based on the previous reviews, but I think these leggings were only fine.  They are a good price at $16.99, so I've kept them, but will be curious to see how they hold up.\n\nSo overview, for the price I'd buy them again, but if I wasn't pregnant and looking for some thick leggings, I'd definitely pass on them.\n\nPros:\n-they are thick so can be used as pants and not just with dresses,etc that you have to with thin leggings\n\nCons:\n-while I appreciate that they are thick, I don't love the material - per my earlier comment, they're too sweatpant-like (or like thick tights) for my taste (although to be clear, they're not baggy like sweatpants, it's just the material that reminds me of them)\n-I decided to go with the medium and they fit nicely around my legs but are baggy at my belly - so they have room to give, but would prefer they were designed so that they grow with you as opposed to me having to grow into them",3

"This bra works fine when nursing or pumping but the fabric is very thin and scratchy. It is not comfortable at all for sore nipples. It would be nice to have some type of thin padding to provide a little coverage and shape. The straps are very thick and it wears more like a sports bra than one you would wear under regular clothing.",3
"Very comfortable fit but the latches are hard to use especially one handed with a crying hungry baby in the other hand.",3
"I like the length of these and they're great to wear with boots, but the seam between the back of the pants and the panel feels a little low and hits me in an uncomfortable spot. It makes it feel like my pants are constantly falling down.",3
"Was looking forward to having some good support, however the extra and thick padding in the cup makes the bra feel somewhat uncomfortable for a mother with a larger bust. It's also not as supportive as the description suggests.",3
"Returned this bra--only one that in XL seemed a wee bit big on me. Padding was overkill--but maybe perfect for someone not a 40DD. Straps were puny and didn't provide enough support.",3
"I am currently 8 1/2 months pregnant and bought this bra to wear at night and to nurse when the baby is born. While this bra is made of a soft, super stretching material it makes my breasts itch like crazy whenever I have it on. I feel it doesn't offer any shape to my breasts like the photo shows but since I will just be wearing it at night once my baby arrives it should be ok, as long as I can stop itching in it!",3
"Although I read in a previous that this was not meant for curvy women, I purchased it anyways. It bends at the waist and creates a bulge which in turn looks horrible. I purchased the correct size (as per website) along with the belly bandit binder (used underneath the belly bandit itself) and it fits fine once I stand up, the issue is once you sit and then stand. Unfortunately I would not recommend spending so much money on a similar product that can be purchased elsewhere for half the cost.",3
"I recently purchased the BelleShield and Bamboo Bandit and have to say that although the product works well, it is of poor quality. I have worn the shield and bandit itself a total of 7 times and the shield has torn at the seams where the clasps are (not due to the size I ordered, I promise). The wrap itself is also too long for my torso and bends under my clothes, and unless you wear a loose top, it is clearly visible under clothes. With this being said, the product DOES work, I just wish it was a little higher quality.",3

"It is a great little lightweight t-shirt, but the biggest problem is that the v-neck drops so low. I 6' tall and I can't imagine what the shirt would look like on a shorter person. I need to constantly readjust it. If you have a larger chest then it might work, but for me it is awkward.",3

Way too tight, and since the fabric has no stretch, they don't really fit comfortably. I bought it to be worn out, but know it'll be a stay-at-home, hanging out top! Merona, or Target clothing designers, need to adjust the sleeve size to match the overall size of the item.",3

I understand this can happen but there was no warning tag saying wash by itself or anything. Even the sewn in tag says nothing about washing it separately. And it wasn't just light colored clothing that was stained. I'm so mad. The red splotches better come out in the wash.",3
"Top runs pretty small. I'd get 1-2 sizes larger than what you normally wear. I also don't consider it a sweatshirt. It's lightweight.",3

"First of all, this top is adorable!! I love the texture in body and the slight woven texture in the sleeves as well. I am usually between a L and XL. This top is structured (while still being soft and comfortable..) so it's not very forgiving for size. Getting this top oversized is extremely baggy and sloppy looking. I first got an XL and reordered it in a L. The body fits great. It's close fitting but hides imperfections. Hpwever, The sleeves are WAY too short (as the size XL was as well). for reference Im 5'8\",3

I was so happy with the purchase, but when I got home I realized one of the tassels had fallen off and was missing. It's so disappointing because they were part of my favorite thing about the top.

"I actually found these in my local Target and instantly bought them. I got Toad and Peach and later went back for Mario, Bowser, and 1up. The tops fit VERY nicely, however the bottoms are two sizes too small. I bought a large set (I usually wear medium) and the bottoms honestly fit like a size small. After washing them one time, they became a size xs. I ended up tossing the bottoms and only keeping the tops. Kind of disappointing because the bottoms were extremely cute.",3

Last night, the cuffs were cutting off the circulation to my calves, as they rode up my leg! Would agree with another review and use other red pants as the bottoms instead of these ones.\n\nMy daughter's fit well, so maybe it's just the adult sizes that are not long enough.",3
"I read reviews before buying this for myself and as a gift for my sister. I happen to be a size 0 but also have muscular arms so I appreciated the specifics from a previous poster. I still went with a Small. I tried it on when it arrived and thought it fit great but it's been washed and it shrank to fit like I'd expect an XS. I'm disappointed. At least I bought during a sale. Definitely size up!",3
"When I first bought this night gown, I loved it! I wore it all the time,,,until it came to washing it. After it was washed, it shrunk so much, I can't even wear it anymore. I had purchased an xs, I wish i would of known this a head of time so I could have gotten a small/medium instead. Be very careful when washing, other than that, I did love it and I will miss wearing it until I purchase another in a bigger size.",3
"This nightgown was stretchy and comfortable and the floral pattern was very cute. The top has pads that are removable. I did end up returning it though because the top is very low cut and I do not find that comfortable for sleeping. The shoulder straps are adjustable, but even after tightening them up, it still showed a considerable amount of cleavage. I was sad to see it go, especially with such a reasonable price, but it didn't work for me.",3
"I loved these when I first bought them, they are pretty and so comfortable. However, when I washed and dried them (following the instructions on the tag) they shrank considerably to the point I can't really wear them anymore. The trim also got wrinkled beyond what could be fixed with ironing. I'd recommend hand washing or air drying.",3
"Adorable, but notably shrank after washing, so I really don't wear them anymore.",3
"There is no way this is women's sizing. It has to be junior sizing.",3
"Nice look and feel but runs small by 1-2 sizes. Will shrink even more in wash.",3
"Really love this chemise until I washed it. Shrunk like crazy! I'm talking several inches shorter after laundering as recommended on the tag. I am going to return and repurchase in a size larger hoping that when it's washed it will fit the right way.",3
"These are soft and comfortable Pjs. Unfortunately, after a few wears, they have started pilling, so I am not sure how long they will last.",3
"While these look and feel great after the first wash and dry the pants shrunk about 2 inches. I now look like I'm waiting on a flood. The fit is also a little tighter.",3
"The design and rayon fabric is nice, but the fit is very small and narrow. I didn't try it on because it's just a nightshirt, but small fits like x-small and is uncomfortable to sleep in.",3
"Super cute and comfy but, order larger then normal. I tried on and almost returned before washing because very big, washed and perfect size.",3
"I like the fit of these PJs, mostly the pants I guess. The pants are long, drag on the floor, and I'm 5'8\",3
"I expected a heavier weight material for these and wanted something I wouldn't have to cover up with a robe when lounging around the house in front of my kids, but the material is so thin that you can see right through the light colored pants and every detail of my chest through the thin shirt. The fit is good, not too big or too high of a waist like I find with many plus sized pajama pants, but I expected a heavier weight to the material, like a typical t-shirt weight, but this is much much thinner. I guess it is soft, but its definitely being returned.",3
"i love the pattern and the fabric of these. They are very cute and i thought i was going to have to cut a few inches off the legs because they were so long but after washing them, they fit perfectly. so beware, if you do buy them, they will shrink in the wash but its good for shorter people like me.",3
"Small in the arms, women with muscle beware! I also wouldn't put these through the dryer because they'd probably shrink. Very comfortable and cute. I just wish XL was true in more than just the waist.",3
"The graphics are nice and the fabric is soft but it is so thin. I can hold the pants up and see through them. So if you are wearing this around other people make sure you wear that appropriate undergarments so as not to flash them all!",3
"I bought this as a gift for my friend - it was no means a bad product - but there were strings hanging off of it before I took it out of the package and it just seemed cheaply produced. Got the job done, but like I said, you get what you pay for. :-)",3
"The bride liked this gift, it was just a little thin.",3
"I love these pajamas, they have cute prints, they are very comfortable! However, I'm 5'5 - the average height for an American woman, and I had to destroy the hem of these pajama bottoms with scissors because they were at least 5-6 inches too long. I feel bad because the print is so cute and now the edges look ratty because I had to shorten them. Luckily, I bought them on sale for half the price here so I didn't mind taking the scissors to them, but if you're getting them at $16.99 I'd say try a different brand.",3
"Styling of this robe is a 4-5 star, but the fabric is kind of stiff even after washing. That's a disappointment, especially in a sleep/lingerie item.",3
"The fabric on these joggers is so thin, it's nearly see through. I am really disappointed because I assumed they'd be warm for winter.\n\nI still love them though because the fabric is also really, really soft, the pants are crazy comfortable, and of course the sushi print is awesome.",3

Would agree with another review and use other red pants as the bottoms instead of these ones.\n\nMy daughter's fit well, so maybe it's just the adult sizes that are not long enough.",3
"I read reviews before buying this for myself and as a gift for my sister. I happen to be a size 0 but also have muscular arms so I appreciated the specifics from a previous poster. I still went with a Small. I tried it on when it arrived and thought it fit great but it's been washed and it shrank to fit like I'd expect an XS. I'm disappointed. At least I bought during a sale. Definitely size up!",3
"When I first bought this night gown, I loved it! I wore it all the time,,,until it came to washing it. After it was washed, it shrunk so much, I can't even wear it anymore. I had purchased an xs, I wish i would of known this a head of time so I could have gotten a small/medium instead. Be very careful when washing, other than that, I did love it and I will miss wearing it until I purchase another in a bigger size.",3
"This nightgown was stretchy and comfortable and the floral pattern was very cute. The top has pads that are removable. I did end up returning it though because the top is very low cut and I do not find that comfortable for sleeping. The shoulder straps are adjustable, but even after tightening them up, it still showed a considerable amount of cleavage. I was sad to see it go, especially with such a reasonable price, but it didn't work for me.",3
"I loved these when I first bought them, they are pretty and so comfortable. However, when I washed and dried them (following the instructions on the tag) they shrank considerably to the point I can't really wear them anymore. The trim also got wrinkled beyond what could be fixed with ironing. I'd recommend hand washing or air drying.",3
"Adorable, but notably shrank after washing, so I really don't wear them anymore.",3
"There is no way this is women's sizing. It has to be junior sizing.",3
"Nice look and feel but runs small by 1-2 sizes. Will shrink even more in wash.",3
"Really love this chemise until I washed it. Shrunk like crazy! I'm talking several inches shorter after laundering as recommended on the tag. I am going to return and repurchase in a size larger hoping that when it's washed it will fit the right way.",3
"These are soft and comfortable Pjs. Unfortunately, after a few wears, they have started pilling, so I am not sure how long they will last.",3
"While these look and feel great after the first wash and dry the pants shrunk about 2 inches. I now look like I'm waiting on a flood. The fit is also a little tighter.",3
"The design and rayon fabric is nice, but the fit is very small and narrow. I didn't try it on because it's just a nightshirt, but small fits like x-small and is uncomfortable to sleep in.",3
"Super cute and comfy but, order larger then normal. I tried on and almost returned before washing because very big, washed and perfect size.",3
"I like the fit of these PJs, mostly the pants I guess. The pants are long, drag on the floor, and I'm 5'8\",3
"I expected a heavier weight material for these and wanted something I wouldn't have to cover up with a robe when lounging around the house in front of my kids, but the material is so thin that you can see right through the light colored pants and every detail of my chest through the thin shirt. The fit is good, not too big or too high of a waist like I find with many plus sized pajama pants, but I expected a heavier weight to the material, like a typical t-shirt weight, but this is much much thinner. I guess it is soft, but its definitely being returned.",3
"i love the pattern and the fabric of these. They are very cute and i thought i was going to have to cut a few inches off the legs because they were so long but after washing them, they fit perfectly. so beware, if you do buy them, they will shrink in the wash but its good for shorter people like me.",3
"Small in the arms, women with muscle beware! I also wouldn't put these through the dryer because they'd probably shrink. Very comfortable and cute. I just wish XL was true in more than just the waist.",3
"The graphics are nice and the fabric is soft but it is so thin. I can hold the pants up and see through them. So if you are wearing this around other people make sure you wear that appropriate undergarments so as not to flash them all!",3
"I bought this as a gift for my friend - it was no means a bad product - but there were strings hanging off of it before I took it out of the package and it just seemed cheaply produced. Got the job done, but like I said, you get what you pay for. :-)",3
"The bride liked this gift, it was just a little thin.",3
"I love these pajamas, they have cute prints, they are very comfortable! However, I'm 5'5 - the average height for an American woman, and I had to destroy the hem of these pajama bottoms with scissors because they were at least 5-6 inches too long. I feel bad because the print is so cute and now the edges look ratty because I had to shorten them. Luckily, I bought them on sale for half the price here so I didn't mind taking the scissors to them, but if you're getting them at $16.99 I'd say try a different brand.",3
"Styling of this robe is a 4-5 star, but the fabric is kind of stiff even after washing. That's a disappointment, especially in a sleep/lingerie item.",3
"The fabric on these joggers is so thin, it's nearly see through. I am really disappointed because I assumed they'd be warm for winter.\n\nI still love them though because the fabric is also really, really soft, the pants are crazy comfortable, and of course the sushi print is awesome.",3
"This vest is way too long for petites, unless you are a fan of the longer length. Unfortunately, I had to return it. I would recommend for taller women.",3
"I was really excited to see this in mail today, but got very disappointed right after trying it. I'm a petite 5 ft. 3\",3
"This is such a cutttteeeee vest. Its so flattering and gorgeous. I had to return it though because it sheds everywhere! I had a long sleeve black top on when i tried it on and i used several sheets of my lint brush to get off. That wasn't worth it to me but otherwise adorable.",3

"I received these jeans as a sample to review. Overall, I felt that the jeans were of good quality. They fit very well, I am only 5`4` and I felt that the length for being regular was pretty good for me. They are a stretchy type of jean and they do tend to stretch out after wearing them all day. I would wear them, but they are not my favorite.",3
"The jeans are MUCH darker than the picture. Comfortable fit but very very dark in color. I would have liked them lighter but plan on keeping them because they are so comfortable.",3
"I just got these in the mail.  They are good jeans- stretchy, good length, comfortable. etc.  However, I will be returning these because they are not the color they appear on the website.  They are actually a much darker wash.  I would be fine with this except that I just bought another pair of jeans that is pretty much the exact same color and I don't need two pairs of dark jeans.  I was hoping for a medium wash and these just aren't what I was looking for.",3
"Bought a pair of these jeans from Target a couple years ago....fit was fabulous even at the waistline..they were a size 12 Medium. Ready to buy some more comfy jeans...this time only option is midrise...I'm mid fifties and have had 3 children. Everything about the jeans fit except the waist. I have a high waistline and with a little extra on my midline...not comfy or attractive to have a bulge. Girls we have all seen that and it isn't pretty at all!!! Please give us options on the rise...no more low or mid rise on people who shouldn't wear it. Sorry to say I have to return these and find something else. Thanks!",3
"It's very stretchie, not that tall, but it's not too bad. I just don't care for very stretchie jeans",3
"Not quite as pictured.  The fit was nice but they were almost black jeans.  I took them back.",3
"The dreamsoft descriptor is accurate as these \",3
"I received these jeans as a sample to review. Overall, I felt that the jeans were of good quality. They fit very well, but I am only 5`4` and they were way too long for me. I had to roll them twice to fit inside my boots. They are a stretchy type of jean and they do tend to stretch out after wearing them all day. I would wear them, but they are not my favorite.",3
"These jeans are not bad for the money. I have trouble finding pretty much any pants/jeans that fit me nicely anymore because of my mid-section (kids...). I hate spending a lot of money on jeans that just fit okay - which is every pair. These are stretchy enough to fit nicely and hug appropriately without feeling \",3

"I have 2 other Denizen jeans (curvy fit) size 8 that I love and wear a lot, so ordered these in a size 8. This fit fits one size too large, so I should have ordered a 6. However, I also noticed they are a lot more stretchy than my other Denizen stretch skinnies, which I don't like. Almost like jeggings. And the rise seemed longer/the crotch in the front sagged.  Definitely returning these for a different pair of Denizens.",3

"Surprised at how well they fit; doesn't have an odd smell like alot of black jeans do; material is a bit thin, so I'm unsure how long they will last. I have washed them twice and so far the color hasn't faded. They do have a high waist, so if you don't like that I wouldn't recommend these. I'm 5'2\",3
"The pants bunched in the groin area. The waist was a bit big, but the thighs was okay. The black was rich and the price was nice, but the quality was just not right. Had to return this one.",3
"I returned this item. The fit was perfect but the blend of cotton /elastathene ( 98/2) that I was trying to replace was not the blend in these jeans. They had a 20% content of nylon..and for me that didn't work. It was my fault that I did not read the material content correctly....be careful...the Essential Stretch brand contains a high nylon content....good for some people..not good for others.",3

"I have been trying out a couple of these new \",3
"I rated this 3 stars because although I own about a dozen pair, I've had the same issue now several times.\nThese leggings really are awesome, but beware of missed stitching in the legs. I got a pair from my grandmother at Christmas and had to exchange due to there being a hole in the inner leg. Since then, at least 2 pairs I've purchased have come to me with holes in the legs. It looks like the sewing machine just passed it up while piecing together.\nDue to fit, I'll keep ordering, but I do hope mossimo takes notice of this issue.",3
"I love the print and the fit of these pants except the length. I'm 5'7\",3
"I found these in my local target store and I just loved them. They are wide leg, flattering, and the fabric is super comfortable. I have found that they wash well. My only complaint on these pants is the waist band. That is usually an unusual thing to complain about, but it is a really wide band and tends to fold. I find myself constantly having to straighten it. Other than that, these were a great find.",3
"These are comfortable and cute, but my daughter had a problem with them falling down when doing athletics & dance.",3
"I find these pants to be very comfortable, but the fun fabric is not very sturdy and is beginning to ball up after only three washes. The cut is nice and I love having the decent-sized pockets.",3
"Pant leg is tapered and fitted in the hips. It also has a black leather strip going down the side of each leg, which isn't mentioned in the description. They were promptly returned.",3
"The fabric is pretty good, but that's about it - for me anyway. I'm 5'8, 140 lbs, wear an 8/10 in bottoms, and I purchased these in the Medium. The waist was a little too big, which wouldn't have been a problem if the legs were long enough or the ankles weren't so snug. I knew if I kept them I would constantly be pulling them up. It seems they would work best for someone no taller than 5'4.",3
"These pants are super comfortable! Unfortunately only after a couple wears, the elastic in the waistband that gives it its rouching is coming unstitched - slowly unraveling all the way around :( Difficult to say if I'd recommend them because they are so comfy but they are falling apart already!",3

"Bough this in a size M and L and typically wear a size 10 or medium. I'm an athletic build with a bubble-butt. The medium fit me fine except it was snug in the crotch and a little more low-rise than I wanted. Size large had a higher rise, but looser and longer legs. Not sure which I'm keeping. The print varies, so you may have the vertical stripes in places where it doesn't necessarily slims you.",3

"I got two of these one in the taupe and one in black. The taupe one I tried around the house and fell in love with the comfort, not so much the look. I honestly thought it wasnt appealing. However, I was sold on comfort so I returned the taupe and kept the black, I figured at least you can't tell the design. I regretted this decision after the first day of wearing it!!! I had to return it, this one started to scrape my skin! Ouch!!! If the cimport was consistent it would have been an easy 5 star.",3
"I returned these after receiving them by mail. The fit was true to size for me, but part of one shoe was unraveling at the seam. The popular brand name version of this shoe (S******rs) runs large, and I am between their sizes. Would have kept if not for quality issues.",3

"beautiful color, loved the picture but no support in the chest area at all. had to return",3
"This swimsuit is VERY cute...for someone with a shorter torso. I'm 5'7\",3
"I bought 3 versions of aviators and these didn't make the cut. I thought the blue would be more pronounced, but it was more gray than blue. I put them on and just thought---meh.",3
"they don't work that well. they look awesome, but they don't block out the sun that well. i'd recommend buying raybans. they work awesomely and don't break that easily. good try but they don't work that well. Lots of people ask me how much they are, and when i say the price the say \",3
"their quality is very low, both in that the frame just crack all the time, and the finish on the tortise shell ones always peels off when it's been in contact with human skin for some reason.",3
"I have worn these maybe 3 times and the rubberized material is already peeling off. It's a shame because I love the shape and style so much, I want them to last a while..but I don't see that happening.",3
"I've always wanted this type of sunglasses and when they arrived I was a bit disappointed. They were a bit misshaped and they look a bit crooked it on my face. But I love the color.",3
"These will have prescription lenses installed to have a fun look.",3
"Based on looks alone, they are my favorite pair of sunglasses! My first pair broke very easily (just by unfolding them to put them on one time), but because they are relatively inexpensive, I thought they were worth purchasing again. Hopefully my second pair lasts longer!",3
"This is okay, it doesn't cover my ears fully which is a bummer, but is very soft and cute.",3
"Nice hat. Well made. But ran large. I returned it. Wish it had been smaller.",3
"This hat is warm and comfy, and all recycled. Here's the down fall, get sweater fuzz after a coulpe of wears (still worth it, just a warning) and the button area sticks out much more than I care for, the hat would be so much better without it.",3

"The fabric is soft but too thick. When i wear it makes my head looks big lol. So i returned it.",3
"It isn't thick enough to wear in winter, will not keep you warm. I would've at least kept it if it wasn't so big.",3
"I bought this for summer and it is cute, but it seems to run big. I by no means have a small head, and I wish that this hat fit a little better.. It is just a little big on me",3
"Got this to wear on fall/ winter hikes where I need to shield my ears from wind and cold, but the sharp angled cut of the flap exposes half of the ear. Like the heather grey quilted fabric of the cap and the fit of the cap is fine.",3
"This little hat is cute. It's very warm, almost covers the ears. It runs small. I have very short hair and a smaller than average head and it is tight. Love the furry look. Seems a little over priced. Therefore, my rating is average. I have reservations about recommending it.",3
"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, THIS HAT IS CHEAPLY MADE! NICE COLOR, THAT'S IT! YES YOU CAN GO BUY ONE FOR $40.00 ALL WORTH IT! THE HAT IS SO FLIMSY!",3
"I will be returning because this hat was a little too floppy for me and I wanted a lighter color. Seemed fine quality for the price.",3
"I wanted so badly to love this beanie, but its going back because its too small for me. The band that fits around my hairline is sooooo tight. For reference my head circumference is 22.75\",3
"The quality and feel seem nice but I was hoping for a loser knit that would be a little droopy but it is very tight and holds the beret shape very strongly. Also the edge is very snug and I don't have a particularly large head. I thought it looked bad with my hair and returned it. With longer hair or curly hair it might look nice.",3
"A gift. It is worth the sale price",3
"I have a big head, they seem to fit ok.........not sure how they work because winter has forgotten Indiana so far............",3
"I love the other Merona gloves being offered this year, you'll see my reviews but these do not feel the same. The others feel soft, more expensive and these, while also being sheepskin, feel more rough, which when it comes to leather gloves means cheaper. However, because I love the color I may still keep them since I got them on sale but for the full price I definitely would not. I still feel like it's a bargain for colored leather gloves but like I said the other ones feel much softer. The touch feature works well and I love it since y love for leather gloves usually means having to take them off in he cold to access my cell phone's touch screen.",3
"Very cute hat. but not made in the usa.",3
"Very cute but didn't look good on me.",3
"I have skinny wrists and these arm warmers were simply way too wide. I returned both pair with ease at my Target and actually found some in the store that worked perfectly.",3
"Lovely hat but it runs small. Need to make it larger. I had to return it.",3
"Gloves not as thick as l thought but good for the price...",3
"Wasn't what I expected.",3
"It states rubber sole. The entire shoe is rubber. Not what I expected so they were returned.",3
"Ordered the flip flops in a medium and they are really only size 7-8 the sizing chart is incorrect. Nice flip flops but I'll need to return them to get the correct size.",3
"Flip-flop is light weighted, nice looking, sparkly and do not have bad smell. I bought a Large size. It fits size 9, 10, 11. It will not fit size 12. I have Medium width but those flip-flops is too wide for thick and tall feet. It is WW. On the label the width is not printed. I wear them at home with thick socks but I need to be careful not to trip because it too wide. I ordered them because of the white sole. I have white carpet. The sole is 9/8 of inch thick. I rated three stars only because of very poor product description on Target website. The person who listed this product does not respect Target customers.",3
"I dislike flats so I thought this was a doable throw on summer shoe. The buckle across the top of my foot rubbed and dug into my skin. As I type this I am looking at scabs from the wounds from a week ago. Sadly I returned them.",3
"This is a nice-looking sandal, but the thong strap is not rounded which is uncomfortable in between the toes.",3
"This style is a great idea, but the elastic is unevenly sized. The left sandal is too tight and making my foot go to sleep after a trip to the grocery store. Fyi, my left foot is slightly smaller than my right, and I usually wear a 7 1/2 but sized up to an 8 in these. For the beach or pool, where you will be kicking them off almost immediately, the sling style is great and keeps them securely on until you get there.",3

"I was so excited to receive these but the ankles were a little uncomfortable. Hoping they stretch and soften up some. Cute though",3
"With each step, it sounds like the each shoe is expelling air. Like stepping on a squishy ball of air. Comfortable for short periods of time -- until the big strap rubbing on the side of my foot starts hurting.",3
"I was so excited to receive these but the ankles were a little uncomfortable. Hoping they stretch and soften up some. Cute though",3
"I was expecting them to have a little more pink undertone since the color states that it is Blush. This is more of a tan color. Not sure if I will be keeping them though. They are cute despite the color but once I tried them on they are not comfortable at all. The thong hurts between my toes and I ordered my correct size 9.5.",3
"Very colorful, and comfortable.",3
"These are very cute sandals, but the foot bed is about a size and a half too small! If you order them, go one size up!",3
"Very colorful, and comfortable.",3
"I love the Bravado Bodysilk bra, so I tried this one for a more \",3
"It looks nice and the material is nice, but it's very small. Try to go into a store or order at least 1 size bigger than you normally wear, so 2 for when your milk comes in.",3
"Comfy,good sizing, nice looking,but the underwrites are more 'obvious' on the sides under my arms.",3
"Very, very pretty and fits wonderfully. However, I also chose it for its looks. And it did look fantastic. But....the sheer mesh overlay ripped the first time I wore it. It's a very light and fine fabric and gets a new little hole with every wearing. Otherwise it would be an enthusiastic 5 stars.",3

"It's as nice as the picture but i don't know what they did to get the push up look on the model, i tightened the straps and never got that. But still gave a bit of push up, so not terrible and would recommend for just having a nice bra. I returned it and will go to that overpriced, over scented mall store and pay double the price to get double the push up.",3
"I am a 32A and have a thin body. This bra is perfect for me because I don't need support and can wear this with backless dresses. My mom who is a 36C and my best friend who is a 32B bought them and they didn't give them support at all and their cups were too large. If you're an A cup then this will work, if you're bigger than that then it won't. I give it 3 stars because of the fact that it only works if you have a small chest like mine and not a full chest like my mom and friend.",3
"My friend had an identical bra to this but by another brand that I can not get my hands on so I decided to try this one. I am a 34B and bought the B size, which is the Medium online, I'm assuming. The shape/fit seemed off so I suspected that it may just be too big and I returned it in-store. I just ordered the small size, which would be an A, online. Hopefully this one fits better.",3
"Not sure if I would wear this daily as it likes to cut and roll up on me. This could be a just me problem. I wouldn't go entirely on this review as everything else I have ordered from this company is top of the line. See why I think it could just be my fluffy problem?",3
"This is a nice bra, however, the gel straps either need to be made longer, or eliminated all together, since there is no guarantee they will land on top of the shoulders where they are supposed to.",3
"Unfortunately, I had to send these back! Very disappointed...",3
"I have been wearing the1105 gel strap for many years...however I have read the comments on your site regarding the gel strap isdues...the consumers are correct...it needs to be placed better when adjusting straps...or made longer to accomodate the adjustments.\nAlso you need to bring back the NUDE and BLACK colors....especially the NUDE.\nThank you.",3
"This is a comfortable bra and fits well. To bad it's made of cheap material. After only two wears a run developed on the back near the eyelets. I'll get a couple of more wears out of it and then I'll have to throw it away.",3
"I was disappointed that one of the bras side has a hole in it and I had already wore it and hadn't noticed it until the end of the day when I took it off. Other than that the bra is ok I think it runs a little big and I wish it had one more row of hooks to make it smaller",3
"The comfort of this bra is average. No bra is every truly comfortable to me. I think for a casual bra this one is adequate. As to shaping, this bra provides none! The price is appropriate for what you get....a weekend, bum around the house type bra.",3
"The bra is comfortable once you get \",3
"I like that this bra is soft and supports without feeling like body armor. The band fit well and is true to size, the cups seem to run small. I consistently wear a C-cup, but for this bra, I would really need a D-cup to be comfortable. It makes me feel squished and flat. It is comfortable otherwise all day long.. If I were to order again, I would definitely order a larger cup size.",3
"what extender should i get for a 44 DDD in this brand?",3
"I love the this bra because it gives great support., I find it to be very comfortable. The only negative is that it gets pulls on the lace part. Just from the friction of rubbing against your clothing. Otherwise its my favorite bra.",3
"I've worn this bra before but I had to move up in size for this order. The 44DDD came with additional vertical stays in the underarm area that made the bra painful. There was no indication of this in the descriptions.",3
"After purchasing a lilyette minimizing strapless bra, I was convinced lilyette was the brand I need to buy bras from. Not so anymore. I'm a little D, solid D around my period who rarely ever buys a C but can occasionally. This is a bra I will be needing a C cup in. With the straps tightened the fabric is not quite pulled taunt enough to be minimizing or as supportive as I like. My minimizing Lilyette strapless bra I bought in my regular size 34D and it is tiny and supportive and makes my boobs look like size B! I also purchased another strapless bra which is another style and it is huge! I think lilyette sizing is extremely inconsistent.",3

"I'm glad i read the reviews first before ordering, because they do run very small. I ordered two sizes up, and they fit fine. They feel comfortable, but they are only good for sleeping in and nothing more.",3
"These bras serve their purpose, I can nurse in them. The band around the bottom isn't very comfortable. My biggest complaint is how high the back of the bras come up my neck, it stops about 2 or so inches below my hairline. This drives me crazy.",3
"they are very comfort and wash well",3
"I ordered my normal size and I felt the band was a bit too small. It kind of gives you the look of a sports bra.",3
"I wear a 42G, but thought I'd try the minimizer bra anyway. It did not keep my breasts separated at all. The straps need some type of padding. Won't be buying this again.",3
"I just bought a regular comfort strap bra in a 42DDD because my 42DD's weren't quite cutting it, and the 42DDD was just slightly roomy, and was kind of pushing things too far forward for some of my shirts to fit properly. So, I got two of these to try in a 42DDD, thinking a minimizer would work. They're mostly comfortable, and they do minimize the bustline. However, they are very snug - enough so that they can leave some soreness after I take them off. This was very surprising, considering my other bra in this size was a little bit roomy and these are definitely too tight - they felt about the same as my old JMS comfort strap 42DD's, so about a size too small. Pretty disappointing.",3
"I have several of the old style of this bra and a couple of the new style. The old style had a cotton cup lining, which was comfortable and sweat-reducing. The new style is all polyester, which brings me out in a rash, in the hot weather. It seems that none of the JMS bras are cotton lined any more - I'd pay more for this, but we don't get the choice.",3
"I have been wearing this bra for over 10 years and have a drawer full of them. It used to be perfect, but since the last style changes were made (3-5 years ago?) the straps won't stay in place and keeping sliding off my shoulders - very annoying! Making them shorter doesn't help - it must be the angle at which they attach to the back. Before the changes, it was great. Have been looking for a good replacement ever since. Suggestions?",3
"I have now had this bra (actually several,of them) for half a year at least. The sheer lining on one of them has developed small tears which cause irritation and itchiness. So sad, as I liked the fit and look.",3
"What happened to style #3100. Was so much nicer than this one. Any chance #3100 will be produced again or something similar? Thank you.",3
"These bras used to have more quality. They do not last that long any more. These stretch faster. I still buy them because they fit well.",3
"I got this for wearing it with official dress but it is very much see through. So doesn't serve the purpose.",3
"The bra was true to size and fit. I don't like that there is no padding to prevent showing I of certain areas. The bra makes your breasts pointed, so if your not wearing several layers your breasts appear cone like. It does keep everything in its place and is comfortable though.",3
"Unfortunately, I returned this item as I didn't care for the fabric - found it scratchy. It doesn't compare to the style I liked alot that is discontinued.",3
"The only complaint is that the back clasp part is a bit rough on the underside and causes back itching. I am hoping that frequent laundering will soften it.",3
"I bought the Lace and Smooth because this bra has better color choices than my favorite Flower Bali bra. If you are looking for the best support and a youthful perky look I would suggest the Flower Bali. Being a crossdresser with large man-boobs I have become very picky about my bras. I seen reviews on the Lace and Smooth that it gave a perky look, I do not find that to be true, maybe if my man-boobs were firmer, I find it to be more of a rounded look. The support is good at best for my 40 DD, what do you expect with a stretch lace cup. If you have not wore a Bali brand bra before I suggest going up one cup size, in other brands I only wore a D cup and in Bali the DD fit better than the Bali D cup did. The inner lining of the cups seem a bit scratchy but I know after a few washes that this will go away as it did with my Flowers. I like the fact that the cups are not seemed, but I do prefer the non-stretch cups of the Flower Bali. The straps are just a tiny bit wider than the Flower Bali and a bit nicer material. The best straps, nicely padded straps, are on the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer though. All in all this is a comfortable bra with minimal support, best support is still in the Flower Bali in my opinion. I do like that the underwires lay flatter between the breasts than they do on the Flower Bali. Also there is no padding which I like because the padding never seems to stay in place and in shape after numerous washings. It is pretty sheer though so look in a mirror if you are wearing a light/thin top.",3

"I have been wearing this bra for over 10 years and have a drawer full of them. It used to be perfect, but since the last style changes were made (3-5 years ago?) the straps won't stay in place and keeping sliding off my shoulders - very annoying! Making them shorter doesn't help - it must be the angle at which they attach to the back. Before the changes, it was great. Have been looking for a good replacement ever since. Suggestions?",3
"I have now had this bra (actually several,of them) for half a year at least. The sheer lining on one of them has developed small tears which cause irritation and itchiness. So sad, as I liked the fit and look.",3
"What happened to style #3100. Was so much nicer than this one. Any chance #3100 will be produced again or something similar? Thank you.",3
"These bras used to have more quality. They do not last that long any more. These stretch faster. I still buy them because they fit well.",3
"I got this for wearing it with official dress but it is very much see through. So doesn't serve the purpose.",3
"The bra was true to size and fit. I don't like that there is no padding to prevent showing I of certain areas. The bra makes your breasts pointed, so if your not wearing several layers your breasts appear cone like. It does keep everything in its place and is comfortable though.",3
"Unfortunately, I returned this item as I didn't care for the fabric - found it scratchy. It doesn't compare to the style I liked alot that is discontinued.",3
"The only complaint is that the back clasp part is a bit rough on the underside and causes back itching. I am hoping that frequent laundering will soften it.",3
"I bought the Lace and Smooth because this bra has better color choices than my favorite Flower Bali bra. If you are looking for the best support and a youthful perky look I would suggest the Flower Bali. Being a crossdresser with large man-boobs I have become very picky about my bras. I seen reviews on the Lace and Smooth that it gave a perky look, I do not find that to be true, maybe if my man-boobs were firmer, I find it to be more of a rounded look. The support is good at best for my 40 DD, what do you expect with a stretch lace cup. If you have not wore a Bali brand bra before I suggest going up one cup size, in other brands I only wore a D cup and in Bali the DD fit better than the Bali D cup did. The inner lining of the cups seem a bit scratchy but I know after a few washes that this will go away as it did with my Flowers. I like the fact that the cups are not seemed, but I do prefer the non-stretch cups of the Flower Bali. The straps are just a tiny bit wider than the Flower Bali and a bit nicer material. The best straps, nicely padded straps, are on the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer though. All in all this is a comfortable bra with minimal support, best support is still in the Flower Bali in my opinion. I do like that the underwires lay flatter between the breasts than they do on the Flower Bali.

"The foam lined cups are great for eliminating show through. They do however fit smaller than other Bali bras, so I'm thinking a larger cup might provide better coverage and support, eliminating spill out.",3
"I bough this bra along with a Platex 18 Hour one, and I feel like if I could combine them into one, that would be the perfect bra. The Bali Comfort Revolution is indeed comfortable, but it's not very supportive.",3
"There is a crease in the middle of each cup that doesn't go away. Not sure sure if it was creased during shipping or if it was packaged wrong. The padding is not as thick as I would have hoped. Does not look good under t-shirts or any thin fabric. The crease is very noticeable. Seems to fit okay otherwise. Will probably not wear it much; maybe with sweats this winter.",3
"Love the bra hate the smell. I bought three bras all three smelled like mold and mildew. I was able to send one back but I tried to wash the smell from the other two even putting one in the washer on hot with bleach. The smell is less but still noticeable.\nLove the bra but the smell is awful",3
"Good fit, but the outer material pills up and has become rough",3
"The bra is comfortable but doesn't provide much support. The band around the chest is flimsy and doesn't stay in place.",3
"Initial reaction is not good - the \",3
"This bra runs small in both cup and band size. The comfort was there but only as long as I was sitting on my couch. I will return it for a larger size.",3
"I am pleased that I could purchase this brand with a DDD cup...but what would really make it perfect is if the back straps were set closer to the center back. The straps still slip off my shoulders constantly making it difficult to call this an \",3
"I bought this bra because my old one we're getting worn. Here's my only issue. I also like to wear exercise tops made of wicking material---the thin ones that match many exercise/yoga pants. This bra would be perfect if it somehow also had built in modesty pedals. I hate nipple show though!!! I'm surely not the best not woman with this issue! Make a sports bra that prevents nipple show though for us !",3
"I cannot find a bra anymore, like the ones I used to get from you. Just want something with a bit of support, but not an underwire. Lightweight, cool, and only two hooks. One I am not aware of when I am wearing it! Thought this might work, but it is \",3
"Unfortunately for this particular style it offered me no support whatsoever. I had ordered two of these in different colors, and had to return the unworn one because, again, it did not offer the support I need.",3
"The B-cup is slightly bigger than the standard/regular B cups I get from Maidenform. So unsightly wrinkles show as the material doesn't lie flat. Sigh.",3
"This bra is comfortable BUT (1) nipples do show so it should not be an active-type bra and it is very large. I am 5'5 120# and small- boned. Will keep the bra but won't buy again. (well made)",3
"very comfortable as far as fit, but offers little in the way of support for larger breasted women. Also while straps are wider, they still dig in because they fold over, and under breast band rolls up unless you have a flat tummy.",3
"This bra is very comfortable and fits well with one exception...if the straps aren't adjusted so they're as long as possible it cuts into the underarm area. Also, I'd prefer it if there wee 3 hooks instead of 4 and wish the product description included that important detail.",3
"I returned this bra because it just had too much padding.",3
"This is advertised as same as style 4513 which I have ordered before and really liked. It is not what I expected. It was cheaply made...not the same quality.",3
"bought 3 and will be returning 2..I took the tags of off of one... they don't fit the same as style 4513",3
"Playtex is obviously for the \",3
"It looks awesome. Good material. It just doesn't sit right with me. I feel like it's made smaller than usual",3
"I exchanged the black/gold because I didn't like the color. I am waiting for the new colors to arrive",3
"I bought this about two weeks ago. It's a nice bra, but I felt it did not give me the support I was looking for.",3
"More pretty, colorful, fun bras in band sizes larger than 44, please. Also, please offer more front-close bras--not the hook-and-eye type but the single-hook close like the Glamorise Front Close Underwire Bra, Style 24357, for women with difficulties using their fingers and hands. Surely it can be done! And one more thing: For those of us who are short, the wire is too long and ends up poking into the tissue under the armpit, no matter what you say about \",3
"I'm one of those crazy women that like to just pump one side at a time (I have one side that produces more than the other...almost double sometimes!) and with this bra I do cut my pumping time in half and can pump more efficiently and drain the breast. My only gripe is that I find it sometimes cumbersome and difficult to use so I don't bother. I'd rather just get straight to pumping instead of having to fumble around with the zipper and trying to hold the flanges in place. Also, I'd rather just carry and clean one set of pump parts instead of two. The bra itself is good and the material is thick.",3
"It worked fine until a little after 8 months the velcro completely stopped working. Its totally useless now. I even tried fixing on velcro stickies but that didn't work. I used it multiple times a day so it had a good run. If I were to buy one again I would buy something with an actual bra strap instead of the velcro. I don't know why everyone loves this bra, maybe they didn't use it as much as me and wear it out.",3
"I thought this bra would be a game changer for me while pumping. Turns out, it was more of a hassle to get it on and zipped and the pump in the right place. But once you got it all positioned correctly, it was nice to be mobile or hands free to do other things. Overall though, i'd say skip this.",3
"nipple openings are very close together. adjustment options were not sufficient to line them up for use so it was returned",3
"These types of bras were what I came to this site to shop for and ended up buying one in black and one in blue. The cups on the blue one fit me properly, but the black one (same size) feels a cup too small. Didn't feel like sending back. I wear 38D and I guess these are only sized to go up to a C. I suppose I got lucky with the blue one.",3
"I tried on this bra in store but they didn't have my size so I ordered them from the site. Other people had said they run big but I wasn't expecting it to be as large as it was. Also I received my back order item before the stocked item. It is very comfortable but I recommend buying your true size in a store",3
"I really didn't like this bra. For me it had so much padding that it made the fit uncomfortable.",3
"I bought this in medium and it was too big. I bought it in small and it was too small. The cups are lined, which is nice, but after one wash the cups lost their shape. I returned both sizes. The bra was comfortable but I just couldn't find the right fit. I normally wear a 36B. If you can find one that fits properly, I would recommend this bra.",3

"I'm always looking for a comfortable bra for my narrow shoulders. This is comfy but the straps are too wide, although better than most. Only 3 stars because the outer layer of the fabric tends to crease which shows through my thinner shirts. It can be smoothed out, but the ideal bra would not crease.",3

The removable pads were a joke--how they would ever stay in the right place without being visible circles through the cups is a mystery. Straps nice & supportive but not $50 amazing. 40DD and in my 1st month breastfeeding, so not much has been comfortable so far!",3

While this bra is made of a soft, super stretching material it makes my breasts itch like crazy whenever I have it on.

Wish me luck!",3
"Really have to get use to the under wire it hurts like the dickens.",3
"I purchased 2 of these about 4 months ago and both are coming apart. The straps are fraying along with the pretty lace and the top of the band.",3
"I purchased this bra according to my size, but it didn't quite fit as it should. It was sort of loose around the cup.",3
"I bought this bra and like it fairly well. I would like it better with a little thicker cup",3
"I purchased a variety of bras from Playtex, all in the same size and this one is tight. I am also a little disappointed in the thickness of the cups, they are fairly thin and I was expecting abit better coverage from the description. The support is good though, just small in the band.",3
"They looked great, even with my swimsuit. However, they were heavy. After wearing them most of the day, they felt stuck to my skin and a little sweaty. Great in my swimsuit, but heavy.",3
"You have to stretch this bra out way to much to pull it over you shoulders. After wearing it twice mine started unraveling. This would be great for smaller breast.",3
"It runs really small. I got the XL and I am a 38B and it is really too tight. Once it's on, it's actually pretty comfortable, but I would not get it if you are larger than a 36 or 38B.",3
"The positive features of this bra are it does not have a thick cup liner, it is a simple thin cup with under-wire that is not uncomfortable, it fits well, does the job in a flattering way and it is pretty; however, there is an uncomfortable label that is so annoying, until it is positioned in a way it is bearable, you want to scream and snatch the bra off!! Also, the size for a 34 leaves one on the very end of the hook offerings with nowhere to expand for even a quarter of an inch.",3
"I bought 2 bras in the same style and size, just different colors, and one fits fine, while the other fits a bit too tight. Also, I purchased panties in the same style and size as my current ones (I just needed more), and they fit differently than my existing ones. Not as comfy. A bit disappointing.",3
"Bought my bras and they came in quickly than guaranteed. This bra is a great fit but the straps do not stretch which was a bit of a disappointment.",3
"The size was right, but the fit was poor. The materials and style were great, I just wish it fit right. The upper section of the cup was way too big. I had to send it back.",3
"D cup fits like a C with \",3
"Underwires pinch. Looking fir comfortable. FRONT closure bra.",3

"The bra fits comfortably but the hook is always annoying and rubbing on my back...",3
"I purchased this in size DD in the store and took it home and it fit perfectly! I wore the adhesive bra all summer long and loved how many uses I was able to get out of it! Atleast 20-30 wears.\nUnfortunately when the adhesive started to wear off, I went to FOUR different local targets to find another bra in my size and couldn't find the DD. So I went online to order and the sizing chart was in S,M,L,XL instead of A,B,C,D,DD which is displayed on the box. So I thought I'd order XL hoping it would be DD, but it came as size D instead. Sadly I'll be returning the new one, as the size D does not fit as well and there is no option to purchase DD online.",3
"After reading reviews I was very excited to order. I purchased a large and received a C cup like expected. It comes in a plastic package inside a box. The outside of the cups are a fabric. Pretty soft. Ugly nude color though. The inside was very very sticky, most definitely wasnt worried about it popping off because of stickiness. Now.. I tried it on. Many many many attempts. It will NOT hold my girls. They are simply too heavy I guess... If the cups were thicker and more sturdy I could see this being a great product but it is not meant for those on the bustier side. Very disappointed it is going to end up in the trash. Sorry beautiful strappy summer dresses, maybe next year",3
"I guess the no lining makes them not so supportive, felt like I wasn't even wearing a bra. Won't wear unfortunately.",3
"Appears to be well made. The style is good, with a soft zipper area. My one complain it that it seems to run small.",3
"After trying a number of bras from literally 6 different brands this past month and being professionally fitted twice, I decided to search Maidenform (again). They usually don't sell bras in 40D. But this was available in a 40D so I ordered 3 because of the glowing reviews. It surprises me how many list this as a moderately supportive bra. While it is well made and very soft and comfy, it is barely good enough to wear out in public. The cups aren't really molded at all as reviews and pictures suggest. They are what I would call lightly lined cups. You will have 'show thru' when cold. Also, the sides feel like nothing at all because they don't offer much support and certainly don't smooth you. It is a great house or leisure bra. Almost comfy enough to wear to bed. But not great for all day support.\n\nOne of the good things about this bra however, is that the cup is designed for a lesser top full breast such as I have (tear drop shape). Having nursed 2 children and gravity getting the better of me as I age, most of my breast weight/tissue is lower. I struggle to find bras in my size that fit well because of this issue. Bras for full figure women are always made for breasts that are perfectly round and full at the top and bottom. Very frustrating. This bra is pretty much perfect in the cup fit for me. No top gaping whatsoever. If they could just give it a bit more structure, wider straps too, you'd have the perfect bra and I would have given it 5 stars hands down.\n\nI would recommend this bra for smaller woman needing light support and light shaping.

But this was available in a 40D so I ordered 3 because of the glowing reviews. It surprises me how many list this as a moderately supportive bra. While it is well made and very soft and comfy, it is barely good enough to wear out in public. The cups aren't really molded at all as reviews and pictures suggest. They are what I would call lightly lined cups. You will have 'show thru' when cold. Also, the sides feel like nothing at all because they don't offer much support and certainly don't smooth you. It is a great house or leisure bra. Almost comfy enough to wear to bed. But not great for all day support.\n\nOne of the good things about this bra however, is that the cup is designed for a lesser top full breast such as I have (tear drop shape). Having nursed 2 children and gravity getting the better of me as I age, most of my breast weight/tissue is lower. I struggle to find bras in my size that fit well because of this issue. Bras for full figure women are always made for breasts that are perfectly round and full at the top and bottom. Very frustrating. This bra is pretty much perfect in the cup fit for me. No top gaping whatsoever. If they could just give it a bit more structure, wider straps too, you'd have the perfect bra and I would have given it 5 stars hands down.\n\nI would recommend this bra for smaller woman needing light support and light shaping. It is sort of a demi cup which works great for 'tear drop' shaped breasts. Wish there were more bras cut this way.\n\nAlso note, I am 5.9\",3
"I just love the look, fit and softness of this bra.... but after only one or two hours of wearing it, the metal strap rings on the back side of the bra starts digging into my back making it too uncomfortable to wear all day :( Sadly, the second bra I ordered will be returned because of this.",3

"Was looking forward to having some good support, however the extra and thick padding in the cup makes the bra feel somewhat uncomfortable for a mother with a larger bust. It's also not as supportive as the description suggests.",3
"Returned this bra--only one that in XL seemed a wee bit big on me. Padding was overkill--but maybe perfect for someone not a 40DD. Straps were puny and didn't provide enough support.",3

"Nice bra. Well constructed. Especially supportive with wide, comfortable straps. Nice looking, too.",3
"Great support and no danger of having uniboob with this bra, but the underwire doesn't lay flat against the middle of your chest. it protrudes outwards where the bow is, which creates an effect that kinda looks like i have a third breast. when i press it down by force the cups look perfect, but they sure don't stay that way. it would be perfect if not for this awful underwire.",3

"I like this bra,and the boost it gives the girls, but it seems to hit right on my pressure points on my shoulders. It sounds crazy but it makes my arms feel like weak noodles.",3
"This bra works fine when nursing or pumping but the fabric is very thin and scratchy. It is not comfortable at all for sore nipples. It would be nice to have some type of thin padding to provide a little coverage and shape. The straps are very thick and it wears more like a sports bra than one you would wear under regular clothing.",3
"Very comfortable fit but the latches are hard to use especially one handed with a crying hungry baby in the other hand.",3
"This bra is very comfortable. I purchased two of them. After washing them, the under wire was bent in both. Disappointed.",3
"Love the idea... It does work, it's soft and stays put. But for $30 you think they'd put a more durable zipper on it for someone to take on & off 3 times a day. It has only been 3 months! It's not like I'm abusing the thing and I'm not a large woman.",3
"I love the concept of this bra! It is quite hard to get on when you are alone. I have to hold the top part with my teeth in order to zip it up. Or, I have to zip it then put it over my head. The zipper is of poor quality and gives me a lot of trouble. I wear a size 34C bra and a medium wouldn't even come close to closing, so the size chart was way off for me. But, when this bra does work it is amazing!!!!! I doubt this bra is going to last a full year of pumping, but I will buy another one because it is amazing when it does work.",3
"I purchased a large and went according to the size chart. It's a little large for me. Also I don't have a Medela breast pump and thought that it would still work with my breast pump which it would if I had purchased a medium. [...]",3
"This product is just ok. It does it's job however don't fall asleep while using if you move just a little it will loose suction and get milk everywhere. Good for sitting up strait doing work not relaxing In a chair.",3
"As other reviews say, this runs small. I was at the upper end of Small on the size chart, and the Medium ended up being pretty snug. The bottom of the zipper needs to be coaxed to align...it seems like it won't hold up over time. That being said, this item does the job...it's nice to be able to pump hands-free!",3
"I'm a 36C in my nursing bras and SHOULD wear a medium according to the size chart. It was way too small! The zipper is also a really bad design for something that needs to fit tightly, and should have bra snaps on the front instead. The material is really nice despite the design flaws.",3
"I bought this product because I wanted to be hands free and I didn't bother shopping around for other options. It works, but is a huge pain to change into every time you want to pump (especially in the middle of the night). Also, the zipper nearly broke within the first 10 wears and I spent half an hour in the middle of the night trying to fix it. There are much better options out there that are more functional, more comfortable, and higher quality. I now use the Rumina Pumping Bra, which double as a nursing bra. MUCH MUCH better option. AND it can be worn as a regular bra for convenience of pumping at work, etc.",3
"I'll look for a different one next time. I'm really busty and it seems to stretch out some. If I don't zip it just right the zipper pops at the bottom. It's kind of hard to get on with the front zipper.",3
"This was a great relief. Allowed me to perform various tasks while pumping and prevents tiring from holding the pumping apparatus in place. However after 4 months of use, the zipper broke and I am now shopping for another bustier. I used it a lot as I pump exclusively, 4-5 times a day but I think it could be more studier than that. It is also a little on the costly side.",3
"Very happy with the fit and look, but due to my large size, it does not give the support I was hoping. I will keep and wear as a weekend casual - not to work.",3
"However, larger cups do not necessarily translate into straps that are so far apart that you must constantly be pulling at them to keep them from sliding off of your shoulders. Most annoying as this could be a really great bra.",3
"I purchased two of these bras, which I have done many times. It is a very comfortable and well fitting bra. Unfortunately they were not the same size. This has happened before. One bra is 2 inches smaller than the other one. It seems to only happen in the colored bras. Love this product but this time I am going to return the one sized wrong. Quality control is lacking.",3
"It's okay. There is no padding. So when you are cold your nipples will poke through.",3
"The bra is pretty, and fits well (34C) but the sheer panels give less support for more dense breaststroke.",3
"Cup size seemed appropriate, however I ordered a 42 and had to send back for a 40 (still waiting). The 42 was what I had been using previously and if anything I had gained a little weight, so was surprised when I put this on, used the tightest clasp setting and still wasn't seeing the support I needed. Also, the shoulder straps, fully collapsed to their shortest length, seemed too lengthy.",3
"had to send back because it was just too big. should have ordered a smaller size",3
"good quality bra, but stretchy material in the cup provides no support for cup size DD",3
"I found this bra to be a bit stiff and the cup has a funny insert at the bottom that cut into my breast and gave it a funny shape. But to be fair, I may have needed a bigger size. I returned them.",3
"I have been buying these same bras for many years. I love the fit and comfort. ONE\nsmall problem, which can happen while quite new, and even later - the underwire begins to poke through under the arm. I have sewn extra lines to keep it in, but it eventually pokes through again. If Playtex wanted to, I have a great solution. Just join the wires at the center front. Most days, I have to pull the material around to get the wires away from the underarm seam. I love these bras so much, I continue to deal with the problem, but OH, how I wish they would solve this problem! Otherwise I highly recommend this bra.",3
"I bought 6 of these bras because of the support and fit since I am very full busted. Basically it's a great bra however I had problems with the underwire tips coming off causing the wire to break through the fabric, making it unwearable due to the wire stabbing me in the under arm. This did not happen on all of them but the ones that did happened within the first 2 weeks and I hand wash and hang dry my bras.",3

"I like this bra, chanced upon it one day at the outlet mall, but I need a 46B and it only goes up to 44B, so is a little snug and I went back to my Bali style of many years which I was trying to get away from as it is not of the high quality it used to be. The straps on this style are torture machines--non-stretch is better for support, but please, give us some padding and make the straps wider for comfort! I also prefer front adjust vs. back, but can work with it. So far, I am trying to be impressed as the price is better, but you have a ways to go to impress me on this one.",3
"I like this bra but I need it to be a 52 dd and they don't have them anymore... please make bigger sizes",3
"just not right for me, have yet to find a bra that fits a short fat person with smaller breasts",3
"was disapointed in bra and returned it.\ncup fabric thin, no lining, also cup shape/size too big and ordered according to instructions",3
"Although I would recommend this style to others, be sure of your measurements. It seems snug, especially in the straps-tends to ride a bit high. It is a nice bra, just takes me a bit of getting used to (compared to the other styles I have) when I have not worn this style for a few days.",3
"Its a great fit, but I wish the straps had some cushion. Very comfortable, except for the straps.",3
"I found the better side suport on this bra and will keep the two I bought.\nMy one negative is wish they had made the straps wider.",3
"As I have gotten older I have noticed an increase in my reaction to breezes/chills/air conditioning where everything starts to POP UP..... so I was looking for a bra that would help conceal this. I could not find a bra in my size that had the concealer petals and I don't want to wear a stick on thingamajig so I tried the double layer fabric on that was advertised for this bra. It doesn't help with concealment as much as I have wished. The fabric is more of a spandex than the cotton bras I was used to so the comfort is not really there. The tradeoff is that the bra seems to wear better. It is smoother and it lifts okay... but still not exactly what I wanted.\nThe other concern was the bra straps. I haven't noticed any problem with these skinny straps- I am used to the wider straps. I just wish someone would come up with something that is smooth, comfortable, and had concealment without overpadding the cups.",3
"I bought and tried this bra for the side smoothing but basically came out wondering if I bought the wrong size. Cups fit great but the upper part of the sides felt gappy. The straps definitely need to have some cushioning and this is not a bra for hot weather. Felt like I was in a sauna. If I was going to re-engineer This bra I'd cushion the straps and use a more breathable fabric for the cups.",3
"I wore this bra for the first time today, all day. I was really very pleased with the fit. It minimizes great and the side support is quite a nice feature. Unfortunately, as others have stated, the straps are extremely uncomfortable. I am aching alot through both shoulder blades. I would recommend it for true fit and eye appeal; however, I would also 'warn' about the straps.",3
"I looked forward to this bra for the side smoothing detail. I have always found JMS bras to be comfortable with the straps nice and wide. This bra has narrow uncomfortable straps. I ordered 2 and will be sending 1 back!",3
"I bought this bra 3 weeks ago, It's a nice bra but when I put it on with a then Blouse or sweater you can see my nipples , Not very happy with this purchase!",3

PLEASE TELL ME YES YOU WILL START CARRYING IT REAL SOON!!!!!",3

"It's not bad as bras go, but a little different than what I'm used to. It lifts and separates more than it creates cleavage like it's doing in the picture. It's also a bit torpedo-like. Good for someone who likes this type of bra, but I wouldn't buy another one.",3

"Unfortunately my purchase didn't work out for me. I tried two sizes and the underwire on neither of them would lay flat. It is too annoying to walk around with the wire away from the body. I will have to try a different brand",3

"This bra is comfortable. I was expecting a little bit of padding but the cups are thing material. In the middle top the underwire from both sides stick out away from the chest and it looks like a big lump under your shirt. Overall it's comfy but with flaws",3
"My estimation of Bali has always been good. No so after these two bra purchases. Both seem like skimpy fabric that won't hold up when washed as often as bras get washed; but then they don't hold me up very good either. Elastic straps, stretchy fabric and sort of elastic back hook section all allow the no underwire bra to just not do anything. The underwire is made cheaply too....also too much stretch. I would love for just one company to make a bra that fits me.....I am a B cup, but need a 48 size...that is a tough combination. Sorely disappointed. Now I just have more bras that I can't wear!!",3

"It's not bad as bras go, but a little different than what I'm used to. It lifts and separates more than it creates cleavage like it's doing in the picture. It's also a bit torpedo-like. Good for someone who likes this type of bra, but I wouldn't buy another one.",3
"i was looking for a comfortable underwire bra and this is not it. the wire sticks into armpit and the front of the wire stands out not smooth. Feels like the wire is to long.",3
"The bra fits me, but there is no spandex to speak of. There's no give, no stretch, so it's not as comfortable as expected. I can wear it fine, as long as I don't plan to do any activities that require movement or exercise.",3
"I bought these bras for my self and my child nice bra",3
"Unfortunately my purchase didn't work out for me. I tried two sizes and the underwire on neither of them would lay flat. It is too annoying to walk around with the wire away from the body. I will have to try a different brand",3
"This bra has a good fit and great support but I was very disappointed by the shape it gave my breast. It made me look very pointed and unnatural. If the cups were more rounded, this bra would be perfect!",3
"I ordered 2 identical bras. One was what I ordered. The other was NOT. But because of the cost I didn't return. The incorrect one is not true to size. Neither has enough support to be sold as full support bras",3
"I have worn Bali Flower Underwire Bras for years and have loved them. My new ones seemed to have changed the straps to more of an elastic feel. I had to shorten them dramatically in order for the straps to stay on my shoulders.",3
"This bra is comfortable. I was expecting a little bit of padding but the cups are thing material. In the middle top the underwire from both sides stick out away from the chest and it looks like a big lump under your shirt. Overall it's comfy but with flaws",3
"My estimation of Bali has always been good. No so after these two bra purchases. Both seem like skimpy fabric that won't hold up when washed as often as bras get washed; but then they don't hold me up very good either. Elastic straps, stretchy fabric and sort of elastic back hook section all allow the no underwire bra to just not do anything. The underwire is made cheaply too....also too much stretch. I would love for just one company to make a bra that fits me.....I am a B cup, but need a 48 size...that is a tough combination. Sorely disappointed. Now I just have more bras that I can't wear!!",3
"This bra seems to run large. I like the fact the support is firm with no spandex, but I don't like the pointy look. I prefer a more rounded minimizing look.",3
"Not every one is the same, sometimes the elastic is too stretched out.\nthey are not as good as they were several years ago.",3
"The white bra fits good but the black one doesn't. I'm a hard size 48b to fit. I'm not sure what's the best site to find what I need. Help!",3
"I have been wearing Flower Bali underwire for about 40 years. I tried another bra, and it wasn't good---no pointing in the breasts. So I went back to the Flower Bali. However the straps are definitely narrower (I have an old one to prove it), and this makes them a little less comfortable.",3
"It upsets me that we have to buy the same bra every time because most other, if not all, underside bras are NOT made or offered for purchase in sizes 32D,32DD, or 32DDD. Not all woman are broad or fat across the back. Same with manufacturers who sell jeans, pants & other clothing without a true waist or waistline, as if all women are straight up or fat from the hips up!",3
"I came back to this bra after wearing another brand for about a year and a half. I love the support but am very disappointed with the side fabric. It is very scratchy and uncomfortable. I am washing again now to see if it softens.",3
"Didn't like the way this bra fit. Ended up sending it back.",3
"I have worn the Bali Flower bra for years and have always been satisfied with them. I purchased three a couple of months ago and one is already showing signs of wearing in the area of the flowers. I don't know if I would purchase Bali bras again.",3
"When seated, the hard wires dig into the top of my abdomen under the center of each cup. My rib cage is there and it is darn uncomfortable. Bra is fine if you are not planning on sitting, but I wore mine to a wedding and when I came home that night, I had huge dig marks in the locations I described. I wear a 50 DD or 50 DDD.",3
"I bought this a couple of weeks ago not sure if I like it. It's a little to pointy, and straps won't stay up. Material is good and seems like it will hold up.",3
"I've worn this brand/model for years and been very happy. HOWEVER: the ones I'm getting on this web site are of poor quality and do not last more than a few months. They rip, tear, wires come out and poke. I don't believe these are made by the same standards as the ones sold in department stores. I'm giving it one last try before I go back to department stores.",3
"The bra fir alright, but I did not like the way it shaped me - I looked like I was about to appear in a Madonna video....haha.\nFor women who like that shape, the bra would be perfect, but I prefer more of a rounded shape.",3
"I chose this bra because of its popularity, figuring it must be a good bra. I recognize that I should have tried the next (number) size up. It was uncomfortably tight. I did not like the cup shaping and fit, and that probably wouldn't change if I had the next size. The fabric on the cups was not what I would choose for comfort either.",3
"I just wrote a message but didn't give all I had to say.\nI buy these bras BUT I remove the wiring,it is a KILLER,HATE WIRING. The sizes don't go high enough so I am looking for another type bra to buy elsewhere.I like the colors in this bra but I need the 34 size with a larger cup size and you carry NOTHING with a larger cup unless you go to a larger size around the chest.Why not serve MORE sizes? Everyone with a larger bust size isn't necessarily larger anywhere else!! I have stuck with you for quite some time but truly am looking else where now!!!!",3
"this bra has great uplift ;however, it is not smooth under knit shirts. great for other clothes.",3
"This does not fit the bill as a comfort bra without any hooks. Also, the fabric is heavier than what I was looking for, and the size was too small for me. Howeve, the bra is made well and would be suitable for anyone.",3
"I bought this bra in nude and white. In the photo it shows a back with 2 hooks. When I received it there were more hooks. Probably because it was a 2XL. It made it too wide. The material is nice and the straps are comfortable. I will keep it but I wanted a more relaxed bra.",3
"I love everything about this bra except the straps, which cannot be adjusted and seem to be too short on me. After wearing for a short while, the bra seems to hike up and I'm constantly pulling it back down. I don't think ordering up one size will solve this problem, so I'm disappointed.",3
"soft &comfy, slightly padded, (s a little revealing when it's cold) straps stay in place.The bottom band is too loose & not supportive enough for me, though overall it seems to be the right size. perhaps better for a smaller size.",3
"Thought I ordered the correct size by the chart, but it was too tight around and the band rolled. I had to return it. Might have been OK in a larger size.",3
"Bra rides up on me. Apparently, one must have more that I do to hold it in place. Very slippery.",3
"was disappointed with the bra. There are 3 hook closures in the back, making it difficult for me, I thought it was a pull over style.",3

"If it were not for the packaging, this would get a five star rating, hands down. However, because they put so much plastic threading through it, the ends snag and become embedded in the fabric. I first bought 2 black ones and were able to cut the tags off okay. The bra fits perfect. However, I bought 3 additional white ones and they ALL are damaged. The other thing to keep in mind is this. The size suggestions are way off. I am a 36C. The large fits me perfect. The small they recommend and the medium are both way too tight and I am not a heavy girl. I would say if you have D breasts you would have to go XL. I will not buy this bra again unless they change the packaging.",3
"This bra is when you need adequate coverage but not necessarily good for support. It couldn't be my everyday bra.",3
"I purchased the largest size which compared to my actual bra size but it is still tight and the band underneath rides up/rolls up. Debating whether to return the ones not used.",3
"Sizes vary. But thought it was smaller than expected",3
"I ordered 2. I trusted the sizing information, but the product is too small. I might send them back or just donate them. Bottom line is I can't wear them. I would recommend the item with the advice to ordered a size up.",3
"This is a very comfortable bra. With that being said, I did not find that it gives very much support at all and it made me look like I was not wearing a bra. I think this would be a very good bra for \",3
"they are good for lounging around the house. If you are big busted not good to wear out around as they do no prevent your bust from moving around",3
"I love them but Walmart stopped carrying them and that was the only place I could get a 3X. I wear 2 at one time for support. 3X under and a 2X on top and they are great. NEEDS TO BE THICKER FOR SUPPORT THOUGH!",3
"They have no hardware and that is good. They look awful - like someone needs to be bandaged after surgery. They do roll though the advertising says they don't. I highly prefer the Barely There crop tops instead, but if these are all I can find, I'll buy them.",3
"had these a few weeks. very comfortable but wish straps were not so wide and arm pit area needs to be a bit larger...rides up sometimes",3
"I BROUGHT THIS ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I DO NOT LIKE IT. THE BAR HAS NO SUPPORT AT ALL",3
"The color is way off. More of a textured red and white not the vivid bright pink fuchsia like pictured. Disappointed!!",3
"Lovely bra the only the sizes run way too small. But I would recommend.",3
"I ordered small bras, based on your sizing chart. I have returned them for an exchange to medium. However, I do believe (with the correct size); I will love these bras.",3
"Nice bra if you aren't top heavy. Buy one size larger.",3
"Followed sizing chart, but not fitting correctly. Fist time trying.",3
"Although the material is very soft and cozy, the bra seems a bit too small for my 36D size and the band always rolls up in the front.",3
"I just received this today. Love the bra. It runs really small. So order a size up. I ordered a 2X which should have covered up to 48 in D cup. I am a 46D. 3X would have been a much better fit. Maybe?? ~~Giggles~~",3
"I was hoping this would work for me but despite size chart, it didn't fit - it was way too snug.\nI will try one on in a store before I purchase again on line. I hope the next size will be fine.",3
"These run smaller than advertised. I should have gotten the next size larger. It is ok.",3
"I like this bra but the sides ride up too high and causes some chaffing. I think this would be better if the sides below the armpit was a bit lower.",3
"I bought two of these, one white and one beige. The white one fit perfectly. No support, naturally, but I was not expecting any. However, the beige one, although the same size, did not fit well at all. In particular it was too snug in the front armpit and left angry red grooves there. I won,t be wearing the beige one again, but I like the white one for casual dress at home.",3
"I thought this bra ran a little small and rather than risk some shrinkage, I opted to return it. The quality was there, just not for me.",3

If you are looking for a leisure bra and the sale is good, then go for it, i think it will hold up well and as I said it is comfortable. I would not wear this for work or any occasion where you want to highlight the girls, but if you just want to cover up to exercise(I do tai chi) or hang out this could work.

"This bra is super soft and comfortable, but if you're looking for support, look elsewhere. I usually wear a 44B or C. I need reasonable support to feel comfortable walking around in public. This bra is basically a leisure bra. I find the straps are far too stretchy to be effective.",3

"I bought this bra with the intention of wearing it for work. I was sampling it at home and found that the tops of my shoulders started to hurt me. I believe this could be remedied if the straps were adjustable. I went to wear it the next day for work and found that my nipples showed through. This would be unacceptable at my workplace. Comfortable bra, but needs a little tweeking.",3
"I had high hopes when I purchased this bra (2XL for 42DD). While it is by far the most comfortable bra I have purchased in the last couple of years *having purchased well over a dozen in various brands and styles), it does not offer any support for us larger sized, older women. It may be fine for younger women with perkier girls.\n\nIt was a good fit for a 42DD. I would, however, caution that if you purchase the 2XL and have a 44 band size, you may find this bra too tight.\n\nA good bra for kicking around the house, but not for wearing out in public if you are the modest type.",3
"First off, it rolls, rolls, ROLLS!! Besides the constant roll-up there are a few other annoyances. I am plus sized and large chested and I don't know about other plus sized women by my body doesn't move the same way a thin woman's does. When I stand up and sit down, when I bend over or just generally move around, bras tend to roll up, ride up, straps twist and all sorts of other annoying things. I think the ride up is caused by having heavy breasts, an ill fitting band and/or straps that are too short. The band on this bra feels snug enough but as I mentioned, the material rolls up all around the bottom. Last complaint is the straps are too short, they make my shoulders hurt. Overall this isn't a horrible bra, it could just use some tweaking in the plus sized range. I bought the underwire version too but haven't tried it yet, let's hope it works!",3
"The bra is very comfortable. I wanted it to wear only around the house when relaxing. I was concerned about the sizing as a D and DD can't usually share the same bra. I was surprised that it did seem to fit well, but by the end of the day my DDs had pulled the back of the bra up. I will keep the two I purchased considering I just wear them at home, but wouldn't suggest them for a DD that wants to wear them out.",3
"I was so excited when I ordered these bras. I thought, \",3
"I ordered two of these bras- one black, the other blue. The blue one was good- soft fabric, gentle stretch, no binding, and lovely comfy back closure. The black one, on the other hand, had something small and very sharp in the back clasp, and the outer fabric lining was bigger than the inner, causing big unsightly wrinkles. I love the blue one, I sent the black one back.",3
"The straps are too narrow and even though the fabric moves with you it doesn't have the support claimed. It is more like a leisure bra to me and I will use it as such. Won't order another of this style.",3
"I had high hopes for this bra even though I realize that having a nylon, wire free bra, give enough support to 40D is not easy to accomplish. Where this bra fails is that the straps are also made of the same stretchy nylon. If the straps had no stretch it would be superior 4-5 star.",3
"I got two of these; one has been very comfortable for the most part, though the back rides up. I like to wear the back of my bras pretty low and adjustable straps would help with that. It is even somewhat supportive, more than most stretchy leisure-type bras.\n\nI like that it has double-fabric. It's not quite \",3
"I love the concept. The bra was comfortable and will probably be fine for most woman with a smaller cup size. However as 42 DD the bra did not give me enough uplift. My breast just sagged. Part could be my age and size, so I will go back to my regular Bali bras which I have worn for years and love. I do like the wireless idea. So perhaps one could be designed with a little more support? The Bali bra was 100% better than the Ahhh Bra which I had also tried and returned.",3

"First off, it rolls, rolls, ROLLS!! Besides the constant roll-up there are a few other annoyances. I am plus sized and large chested and I don't know about other plus sized women by my body doesn't move the same way a thin woman's does. When I stand up and sit down, when I bend over or just generally move around, bras tend to roll up, ride up, straps twist and all sorts of other annoying things. I think the ride up is caused by having heavy breasts, an ill fitting band and/or straps that are too short. The band on this bra feels snug enough but as I mentioned, the material rolls up all around the bottom. Last complaint is the straps are too short, they make my shoulders hurt. Overall this isn't a horrible bra, it could just use some tweaking in the plus sized range. I bought the underwire version too but haven't tried it yet, let's hope it works!",3
"The bra is very comfortable. I wanted it to wear only around the house when relaxing. I was concerned about the sizing as a D and DD can't usually share the same bra. I was surprised that it did seem to fit well, but by the end of the day my DDs had pulled the back of the bra up. I will keep the two I purchased considering I just wear them at home, but wouldn't suggest them for a DD that wants to wear them out.",3
"I was so excited when I ordered these bras. I thought, \",3
"I ordered two of these bras- one black, the other blue. The blue one was good- soft fabric, gentle stretch, no binding, and lovely comfy back closure. The black one, on the other hand, had something small and very sharp in the back clasp, and the outer fabric lining was bigger than the inner, causing big unsightly wrinkles. I love the blue one, I sent the black one back.",3
"The straps are too narrow and even though the fabric moves with you it doesn't have the support claimed. It is more like a leisure bra to me and I will use it as such. Won't order another of this style.",3
"I had high hopes for this bra even though I realize that having a nylon, wire free bra, give enough support to 40D is not easy to accomplish. Where this bra fails is that the straps are also made of the same stretchy nylon. If the straps had no stretch it would be superior 4-5 star.",3
"I got two of these; one has been very comfortable for the most part, though the back rides up. I like to wear the back of my bras pretty low and adjustable straps would help with that. It is even somewhat supportive, more than most stretchy leisure-type bras.\n\nI like that it has double-fabric. It's not quite \",3
"I love the concept. The bra was comfortable and will probably be fine for most woman with a smaller cup size. However as 42 DD the bra did not give me enough uplift. My breast just sagged. Part could be my age and size, so I will go back to my regular Bali bras which I have worn for years and love. I do like the wireless idea. So perhaps one could be designed with a little more support? The Bali bra was 100% better than the Ahhh Bra which I had also tried and returned.",3
"The good news is the bra fits fairly well and it is comfortable. Sadly, I need a 3x (46c) and the sizing chart was accurate. Now the downside. The straps tend to curl up( not uncomfortable but annoying) the bottom curls up - not uncomfortable though. Almost no support in spite of the claim and it rides high in the armpit. If you are looking for a leisure bra and the sale is good, then go for it, i think it will hold up well and as I said it is comfortable. I would not wear this for work or any occasion where you want to highlight the girls, but if you just want to cover up to exercise(I do tai chi) or hang out this could work. Probably fits thin people better.",3
"I love it, but I wish it had adjustable straps. It would really be perfect if I could lift up the girls.",3
"I returned the merchandise and have to go to the store located at Palm Beach in order to find the model I was looking for",3
"I like this bra, except I can't get the straps to lie flat. They curl up and gouge my bony shoulders. Other than that, it's very comfortable, and has good support..",3
"Bali discontinued my favorite wire-free bra, style #3389, some years ago. Since then I have tried numerous brands and styles trying to replace what was an ideal bra for me. When I saw the Bali Comfort Revolution wire free bra, I ordered several thinking this would be it! This is an extremely comfortable bra for all day wear but I find them lacking in cup support as I am a \",3
"This bra is super soft and comfortable, but if you're looking for support, look elsewhere. I usually wear a 44B or C. I need reasonable support to feel comfortable walking around in public. This bra is basically a leisure bra. I find the straps are far too stretchy to be effective.",3
"This was just what I wanted, but it was too small!",3
"I think I may have bought the wrong size although I did follow the chart. The bra makes my breasts into a uniboob. And rides up an rolls around my ribs.",3
"I purchased 3 as they were highly recommended! They arrived in good time. I tried one on and fit great-so washed all. Come to find out they all are marked size large but two of them must be mis sized wrong as they are smaller than the one. Like to order on line as cheaper than store but if sizes arent consistent will need to try each on in store. Disappointed.",3
"The Bra was to large (I ordered my usual size) so I had to return for an exchange.\nThey say 3-6 weeks to be replaced....seems like a long time",3
"I bought this bra in Idaho and was so pleased with it. Then I ordered two more and can't wear them. They have nylon thread in them and I can't tolerate it. I ended up with a big blister on my back which required a Dr. visit and it is just now going away. Otherwise I loved the way it fit and was so comfortable without the nylon thread.",3
"I bought this bra with the intention of wearing it for work. I was sampling it at home and found that the tops of my shoulders started to hurt me. I believe this could be remedied if the straps were adjustable. I went to wear it the next day for work and found that my nipples showed through. This would be unacceptable at my workplace. Comfortable bra, but needs a little tweeking.",3

"This was just what I wanted, but it was too small!",3
"I think I may have bought the wrong size although I did follow the chart. The bra makes my breasts into a uniboob. And rides up an rolls around my ribs.",3
"I purchased 3 as they were highly recommended! They arrived in good time. I tried one on and fit great-so washed all. Come to find out they all are marked size large but two of them must be mis sized wrong as they are smaller than the one. Like to order on line as cheaper than store but if sizes arent consistent will need to try each on in store. Disappointed.",3
"The Bra was to large (I ordered my usual size) so I had to return for an exchange.\nThey say 3-6 weeks to be replaced....seems like a long time",3
"I bought this bra in Idaho and was so pleased with it. Then I ordered two more and can't wear them. They have nylon thread in them and I can't tolerate it. I ended up with a big blister on my back which required a Dr. visit and it is just now going away. Otherwise I loved the way it fit and was so comfortable without the nylon thread.",3
"I bought this bra with the intention of wearing it for work. I was sampling it at home and found that the tops of my shoulders started to hurt me. I believe this could be remedied if the straps were adjustable. I went to wear it the next day for work and found that my nipples showed through. This would be unacceptable at my workplace. Comfortable bra, but needs a little tweeking.",3
"I had high hopes when I purchased this bra (2XL for 42DD). While it is by far the most comfortable bra I have purchased in the last couple of years *having purchased well over a dozen in various brands and styles), it does not offer any support for us larger sized, older women. It may be fine for younger women with perkier girls.\n\nIt was a good fit for a 42DD. I would, however, caution that if you purchase the 2XL and have a 44 band size, you may find this bra too tight.\n\nA good bra for kicking around the house, but not for wearing out in public if you are the modest type.",3
"First off, it rolls, rolls, ROLLS!! Besides the constant roll-up there are a few other annoyances. I am plus sized and large chested and I don't know about other plus sized women by my body doesn't move the same way a thin woman's does. When I stand up and sit down, when I bend over or just generally move around, bras tend to roll up, ride up, straps twist and all sorts of other annoying things. I think the ride up is caused by having heavy breasts, an ill fitting band and/or straps that are too short. The band on this bra feels snug enough but as I mentioned, the material rolls up all around the bottom. Last complaint is the straps are too short, they make my shoulders hurt. Overall this isn't a horrible bra, it could just use some tweaking in the plus sized range. I bought the underwire version too but haven't tried it yet, let's hope it works!",3
"The bra is very comfortable. I wanted it to wear only around the house when relaxing. I was concerned about the sizing as a D and DD can't usually share the same bra. I was surprised that it did seem to fit well, but by the end of the day my DDs had pulled the back of the bra up. I will keep the two I purchased considering I just wear them at home, but wouldn't suggest them for a DD that wants to wear them out.",3
"I was so excited when I ordered these bras. I thought, \",3
"I ordered two of these bras- one black, the other blue. The blue one was good- soft fabric, gentle stretch, no binding, and lovely comfy back closure. The black one, on the other hand, had something small and very sharp in the back clasp, and the outer fabric lining was bigger than the inner, causing big unsightly wrinkles. I love the blue one, I sent the black one back.",3
"The straps are too narrow and even though the fabric moves with you it doesn't have the support claimed. It is more like a leisure bra to me and I will use it as such. Won't order another of this style.",3
"I had high hopes for this bra even though I realize that having a nylon, wire free bra, give enough support to 40D is not easy to accomplish. Where this bra fails is that the straps are also made of the same stretchy nylon. If the straps had no stretch it would be superior 4-5 star.",3
"I got two of these; one has been very comfortable for the most part, though the back rides up. I like to wear the back of my bras pretty low and adjustable straps would help with that. It is even somewhat supportive, more than most stretchy leisure-type bras.\n\nI like that it has double-fabric. It's not quite \",3
"I love the concept. The bra was comfortable and will probably be fine for most woman with a smaller cup size. However as 42 DD the bra did not give me enough uplift. My breast just sagged. Part could be my age and size, so I will go back to my regular Bali bras which I have worn for years and love. I do like the wireless idea. So perhaps one could be designed with a little more support? The Bali bra was 100% better than the Ahhh Bra which I had also tried and returned.",3
"The good news is the bra fits fairly well and it is comfortable. Sadly, I need a 3x (46c) and the sizing chart was accurate. Now the downside. The straps tend to curl up( not uncomfortable but annoying) the bottom curls up - not uncomfortable though. Almost no support in spite of the claim and it rides high in the armpit. If you are looking for a leisure bra and the sale is good, then go for it, i think it will hold up well and as I said it is comfortable. I would not wear this for work or any occasion where you want to highlight the girls, but if you just want to cover up to exercise(I do tai chi) or hang out this could work. Probably fits thin people better.",3
"I love it, but I wish it had adjustable straps. It would really be perfect if I could lift up the girls.",3
"I returned the merchandise and have to go to the store located at Palm Beach in order to find the model I was looking for",3
"I like this bra, except I can't get the straps to lie flat. They curl up and gouge my bony shoulders. Other than that, it's very comfortable, and has good support..",3

"It's okay but not many choices in a size 44 DD. I would like a little more to cover the nipple area.\n\nI love the Bali One Smooth U Underwire but it doesn't come in a 44.",3
"I purchased this bra and ended up returning it because it wasn't what I was looking for. It was a very nice bra but I wanted something with a bit more padding.",3
"this bra is very comfortable..first day on though, thin fabric in the middle and it tore right up",3
"wish I'd only bought 1....it's not a comfortable fit and it's probably because I didn't get to try it on before purchasing....that's the downside of ordering online.",3
"This bra works as functioned. However, it's annoying that if you happen to be a DD cup or below, you get quite a bit of color choice. If you happen to be DDD, it comes in white. That's it. Would prefer to have the same choices that are available to other women!",3
"The cups were too small; smaller than same size in comparable product.",3
"My size is 36DD and this bra works well for me, mechanically speaking. I recommend it for support and comfort. The reason I am only giving it 3 stars this time is that I am disappointed with the color. The ONLY reason I ordered two more is that I thought they were FINALLY offering a nice color in this style.\n\nThey used to offer a bold bright blue, and a cheerful purple in this style. That made me feel happy. I'm tired of the endless off whites - taupe, toffee, sand, steel, beige. They look old and dingy even when new. . And then there are the blotchy ones - polka dots and giraffe.\n\nSo yay, a purple bra is finally being offered in my style! When I opened the package I saw two ever-so-slightly lavender tinted bras, almost plain gray. Sigh. I guess we big breasted women are supposed to try to fade into the gray twilight lit background. Either that or cavort with giraffes. Who comes up with this stuff?",3
"I USUALLY USE MAIDENFORM, BUT DECIDED TO TRY BALI AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE MATERIAL FEELS VERY CHEAP. I HOPE IT HOLDS UP DURING WASHING AND I'M GLAD I ONLY PURCHASED 2. I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK TO MAIDENFORM BRAS.",3

"The color choice is nice but overall this bra is too stretchy to be considered a viable minimizer. Brand-new it starts to give which leads to poor support and much tugging to keep in place (I wear the correct band size so maybe buying a band or cup size down might make help with this issues with this specific bra)",3
"This bra fits well and true to size and I would have given it four or even five stars if the wire wouldn't dig in so bad on the band and under the arms, it has no padding under the bust and after a few hours of wearing it chafes my skin and gets very uncomfortable, under the arms the wire could be shorter and better padded as well. It is minimizing however and I like the way it shapes but the straps dig in on the shoulders as well and could be softer and wider.",3

As soon as I moved around it kept rolling up.",3

I agree with another reviewer, this would be a better design with straps that adjust and a back that didn't. Maybe would recommended for a woman with a smaller cup size. If it were redesigned, I would replace my whole bra wardrobe. As for now, back to the underwires for support and adjustability.",3

"I ordered this bra recently and then ordered more. I have lost weight and was having a hard time finding a bra that fit. These are very comfortable. However, \",3
"This bra is very comfortable, however when you raise your arms it rides up,\nso I'm always adjusting it. I guess it depends on your size.",3
"I bought 2 of them based in the sizing chart and one fits perfectly while the other wont even clasp in the back (too small) now I'm not sure what to order next medium or large? Hmmmm",3
"Found that sizing ran small. Wou.ld feel more comfortable with bigger size.",3
"According to the size chart, should have bought a medium. Bought a size larger because I just didn't think a medium would fit. The large I can't even hook in the back. Cup size was perfect. Disappointed because I bought 2.",3
"I did all the measuring like instructed, according to the numbers & the chart it said I could wear a small, I haven't worn a small since Jr. High, but I ordered a small & just incase I ordered mediums too. Both were too small, I was packed into the medium like a sardine with spillage on the sides, can't stand that. I am going to try again, this time the large, we will see.",3
"The sizing guide is misleading. I wear a size 38DD bra. Based on the guide, I should have ordered a medium. I tried to err, on the side of caution, and ordered a large which was still too small. Passed them on to my daughter, who is very pleased with the fit. However, had she ordered the bras, according to the sizing chart, they would have also been too small.",3
"The fit is fine, very comfortable, but after several washings the straps are constantly falling down. Looking for something else.",3
"This is a very comfortable bra for the weekend or sleeping. It's not very supportive for my 36D size, and the straps keep sliding down, as the straps do not adjust. I bought a Large. I agree with another reviewer, this would be a better design with straps that adjust and a back that didn't. Maybe would recommended for a woman with a smaller cup size. If it were redesigned, I would replace my whole bra wardrobe. As for now, back to the underwires for support and adjustability.",3
"I ordered the BALI 24636--- I went by the size chart, I normally wear a 42D, so I got the XL and it is an awesome bra, but it fits too snug to be as comfortable as it should be..Sooo..... PLEASE make this in a 2X so I can give it 5 stars :)",3
"According to the size chart I should wear a large. Immediately upon trying on this bra the under band rolled up. Thought I should order a size up and the same thing happened. Non adjustable straps offer no support or uplift.\nConcept is good but needs some redesign.",3
"This bra is very comfortable, and the fit is good. It offers adequate support and good coverage. However, the straps in the back tend to roll and slide down sometimes, especially if I move around a lot. I think it is because of the material they're made of. I also wish this style bra would come in a cotton blend so it would be more breathable. I think it may not be very comfortable to wear in the summer months.",3
"I'm not sure why I bought this, because the sizing is never right... This only comes in S,M,L etc. I am of smaller band size and larger cup size, so a large enough cup makes the band way too big. I couldn't get any support from this bra. It's cute and of decent quality though.",3
"This is a beautiful product, but I was disappointed that the cups were too big for me.  I am 5\",3

"This is my 3rd purchase of this style bra, and I am pretty happy, which is saying a lot because I find it almost impossible to find a bra that fits and is comfortable in person, much less online, due to my size. It has good coverage, and nice overall and side support. I would give it 4 stars but...the band, although narrow like I like them, started cutting in a little bit after all day wear, irritating my skin, and since I have to keep the straps all the way up for best fit, it is hard to get the bra off. I usually slip the straps down over my shoulders, pull my arms out, then turn the bra around front so I can reach the hooks, but that's difficult. I would prefer the cups to give a more natural shape, but it's not bad.",3

So I really wish they would move them a little closer to avoid this problem.

"Nice bra, not as supportive as I had hoped, but maybe because it is too large in the band size. I like it well enough to exchange for a smaller size & give it a try.\nThe main thing I don't like about this bra is that the cups are very thin. although it is smooth under clothes. I wouldn't wear it as a Tshirt bra because of the cup thinness.",3

But in the past couple of years or so I've noticed that the band around the chest loses stretchability almost on the first washing. I wash them on warm and hang to dry.

"I found the cups to be smaller and the straps kept falling off my shoulders as they were too far apart.",3
"I thought the bra would have more padding, so your nipples would not show. So, I had to return the bra.",3
"I have worn this style bra for years, but I have gained weight and need the larger size which does not have stretchable straps. The straps are way too short. I will have to return them.",3
"Ordinarily wouldn't have purchased online without trying but can't find my size in stores. Purchased this in Ivory several weeks ago and fit was ok. So purchased two more in other colors while shipping was free. Did not fit well at all! Hate to chance buying again but what choice do I have?",3
"My favorite bra style was discontinued a couple years ago and I have not been able to find a good replacement. The straps on this bra are short and NOT adjustable so my bust is nearly up to my chin! Not a good look and not comfortable. If the straps were longer it would be nearly perfect.",3
"Nice bra, not as supportive as I had hoped, but maybe because it is too large in the band size. I like it well enough to exchange for a smaller size & give it a try.\nThe main thing I don't like about this bra is that the cups are very thin. although it is smooth under clothes. I wouldn't wear it as a Tshirt bra because of the cup thinness.",3
"This is my first wirefree bra in 20 years or more. The bra is comfortable, but the cups are oddly shaped (I wear DD). Instead of a natural, rounded shape, I suddenly have cone-shaped breasts, like twin torpedoes.",3
"If you want comfort, the bra is good. If you truly want support, I don't really recommend. The cup puckers at the sides and it didn't hold up as well as expected (if you get my drift). I'm a DD and need some heavy support.....a little disappointed there.",3

"As a 34DDD I am always on the lookout for a comfortable, supportive bra without underwires. This bra is fairly supportive and I felt like I was being held in well.

"I have been ordering these Bali bras for years. Now they seem to be thinner material in the cups and not as supportive. I would recommend them however to anyone wearing a 40B or below because the straps are elastic in those sizes. Larger sizes do not have elastic straps and they don't stay up!!! I feel this bra has diminished in quality over the last couple years. I'm disappointed because now I have to find something else that will work for me.",3
"I just received this bra a few days ago. It feels great on but I do not feel it gives the support I was looking for. Being large breasted it does not support you so you do not sag. I think smaller breasted woman would love his bra.",3
"Description clearly states bra has molded cups but what was received was more like 2 layers of thin fabric. I was looking for a bra with a little padding to eliminate poke through and help even out sizing.",3
"The straps were not elastic and the cups were not of the same quality as when I've purchased this same bra in stores. It was comfortable but I decided to return and purchase in a store.",3
"This is my 3rd purchase of this style bra, and I am pretty happy, which is saying a lot because I find it almost impossible to find a bra that fits and is comfortable in person, much less online, due to my size. It has good coverage, and nice overall and side support. I would give it 4 stars but...the band, although narrow like I like them, started cutting in a little bit after all day wear, irritating my skin, and since I have to keep the straps all the way up for best fit, it is hard to get the bra off. I usually slip the straps down over my shoulders, pull my arms out, then turn the bra around front so I can reach the hooks, but that's difficult. I would prefer the cups to give a more natural shape, but it's not bad.",3
"I was hoping this bra would be more comfortable than it is. It has 5 rows of hooks, which makes it fit too high under my arm too keep from rubbing at my armpit. If that info had been listed in the description, I would not has ordered this bra...I've never been able to wear a 5-hook bra comfortably.",3

"I have been buying this bra style for years. Just this past year, I have had trouble with the bra straps slipping. I bought 4 bras at the same time, and the straps slip on 2 of them. I did a little research into why bra straps slip, and I believe it is because these straps are set to far apart across the back. So I really wish they would move them a little closer to avoid this problem. I like everything else about this bra, so I purchased a little strap that hooks onto the back of the bra and holds the straps closer together so they do not slip.",3
"This bra would be much better if the bigger sizes had elastic straps..otherwise they keep falling down",3
"I was not really happy with the bra. It fit okay. do not like the stays on the sides. the cups were not a good fit . I will try again.",3

For some reason molded bras just do do not fit right. Back to the search....",3

"The silky nylon feels good on your body but the waist is too low (not full side rise) and the lace waist rolls down with time. Okay for bed but not for all day use.",3
"I was hoping to get some neutral color underwear but what I got was a variety pack of super bright colors that I would probably never wear.",3
"So comfortable at first but by mid-day, these girls are all stretched out, its like wearing man boxers under your clothes. I like to sleep in them, but watch out for flashing through the large gaping leg holes. Hello.",3
"The product stretches out therefore; you would want to buy a size smaller. And the material is very thin.",3
"I received boxer briefs about a week ago. They are OK, but I did not like material texture.",3
"These fit well but the quality of the material is not as nice as some of Hanes other packaged boy shorts. They are ok just not great, price reflects that though.",3
"I have to have boy-leg briefs, and all cotton. I wish these briefs had been a longer length (higher waist), and the option of all white or solids. The fabric doesn't feel soft, like cotton, though it clearly states it is. It has a finely ribbed texture inside where it lies against the skin. Still, I felt I was lucky to find even these. I would like to see more options for senior women, since there are alot of us out here, you know. Loud patterns are not our choice. Picture an elderly lady at her doctor's visit!",3
"THESE ARE NOT BOY **SHORTS**  THEY ARE  BOY  *BRIEFS*\nTHESE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE - BUT I WANTED THE BOY SHORTS",3
"I did not like the way they fit; they were nice but I guess I'm used to hipsters and how they fit.",3
"I have worn these for years, and they're not as good as they used to be. The fabric is not soft anymore and the legs are scratchy.",3
"I bought a pack of these for my daughter and she loves them. But one of the pairs had a busted seam in the crotch area after she wore them only once. I expect higher quality from Hanes, especially for the cost of their products.",3
"They fit exactly as they advertised. I was a little disappointed with the material being so thin. These won't last very long. I expect them to rip after a few washes.",3
"I purchased this on 7/16/15 -- cotton briefs are hard to find. The pack consists of 6 briefs, in assorted body tones. I received one of each color: grey, peach, tan, pink, ivory, and charcoal grey. I was expected more tans, but I guess each color is a body tone. Each color should be shown on the website, not just the tan body tone.",3
"I put my finger through the seam the very first time I wore one. So far the others are fine. I like the fit and the soft colors",3
"While I love Hanes cotton briefs, it is totally misleading to call this assortment \",3
"Bought my usual size in Hanes, size 8. Very tight. I can wear them but I'm afraid if they shrink I won't be able to fit in them.\nWhy are so many clothes being cut smaller when people are getting bigger?",3
"A little on the small side but they don't move around. Will u larger size next time.",3
"I have been wearing these briefs for years, usually in a size 8. They are always well made, and have never had a problem ordering my size in this style and getting a great fit. Recently I ordered a package of size 9... so I threw the packaging out and washed them, because I always do before I put underwear on, but never thought to check them for fit, since in the past, they were so reliable... I was completely surprised to discover the 9's are snugger than the 8's I already own! A little disappointed, as I was looking forward to a little less snugness by ordering a size up! They fit, but just barely. Guess I need to order 10's next time. All those people complaining about not having size 5 anymore should just order the 6.. they'll fit.",3
"fit good at first but, after one wash they shrink. fitting tightly now",3
"Nice colors and price, great fit, and definitely doesn't ride up. However, after a few washings the waist band does start to fray. I hope they address this issue as the product is great in every other aspect.",3
"I've always bought these and loved them, but the material is thinner than it use to be. And out of the six pair in the package, two were cut smaller than others.",3
"I bought these because they looked relatively high-waisted without being specifically shapers, but maybe I'm too tall - they hit my mid-section at a weird place. They're comfy and I'll wear them, but they won't serve as smoothers, which is what I wanted.",3
"The comfort only lasts as long as a few hours. The fabric stretches and doesn't bounce back which creates problems like shifty underwear that can ride up as the day goes on. I love how soft they are. They are very breathable and they last through so many washes. The just need something to keep them planted around the leg holes because the fabric alone isn't too great at staying in place.",3
"I order this thinking I would get the white and grey underware and it ended up coming in a teal and blue color.. Which is not what I was looking for.",3
"No pun intended. These are cut but they run small so you'll spend most of the day picking them out if you go with your normal size. (or maybe they were too large for me, I can't really tell with these since they spend most of their time up where they don't belong). The colors are an issue as is common on the Hanes site. They are not the best. I really wish I would have gotten some neutral tones. But I got a blue you'd see on a pair of undies for little boys and an odd aqua which would have been fine if it hadn't been for the dark blue dots.",3
"Maybe run slightly larger than their other styles",3
"These run small. I have consistently been a size 5 in Hanes, but these were too tight.",3
"I've been wearing this style for years, and I love how they fit and how comfy they are. After many years, mine are starting to wear out though, so I went to the store and there was only one color option in my size. I decided to try online, hoping there would be more options, but we have to take any random color they choose? That's so frustrating! If I'm going to spend money on something that I will wear so often for years, I want it to be in colors that make me happy! I guess I will just be wearing hole-y underwear for awhile :(",3
"As a male, I find the fit and support offered by this product to be great as well as the quality and look. But they keep slipping down in the back as I move around and I have to reach back and pull them up.",3
"The sizing runs small. I like my underwear to fit a little loose so I buy bigger than size would indicate. These run small.",3
"The undies aren't uncomfortable, but they don't meet my needs. The photo looks like they have a little leg length, but in actuality they have very little leg, so little that the leg might as well not be there.",3
"I am 5 ft 2 inches and 140 lbs. In the past size 6 fit me well. In this pack, size 6 is a tad bit tight. Stretch is ok but the material is thin for premium underwear.",3
"I've worn the hipster style of Hanes for a very long time until recently when I have noticed they are much skimpier in coverage than they used to be.  Definitely made smaller.  I had to order up a size now, and changed to the low rise brief for added coverage.  Some packages are still the same comfy, soft cotton, the newer packs seem to be made with a cheaper cotton.  Miss the 'old' hipster!",3
"I have been wearing these panties in white for years and needed to replace some that were stretching out. Was disappointed not to be able to get white and had to settle for \",3
"Nice quality and I liked the elastic at the waist was covered with fabric, preventing the elastic from unraveling. Hope white will be available in the future.",3
"Nice colors and for the most part fit the way I expected them to fit with one exception. The print does not stretch like the solid colors do, making them smaller that the rest. These are also some kind of stretch cotton panties.",3
"I got these underwears and the size 7 seemed a lot smaller than the other 16 pairs of exactly the same underwear.",3
"Whatever happened to white underwear? White is so much easier to bleach if you need to do so. I don't like those prints.",3

The fabric isn\'t sheer which is a great plus and in addition to that it is very light which makes the top super comfortable and fresh, making it a perfect piece for the summer. Its  boxy fit is very flattering and far from being baggy, when put on it looks just like in the picture. Overall I really love this top and would definitely recommend it.",5

"This dress is super cute and comfortable to wear. I extremely like the pattern of the dress. It is simple but flattering at the same time. You'll not regret buying it.",5
"I Stumbled on this dress in the store and instantly fell.in love with it! The material is textured and thick and looks and feels much more expensive than it is! The print is gorgeous and is perfect for fall, but can carry all the way through the winter.Fit and flair style dresses are known for being flattering on so many different body types, and this one is certainly no exception! It's flattering on my larger bust line and emphasizes the smallest part of my waist, while loosely flaring out at the hips and backside. I'm 5'7\",5
"I've been seeing faux suede skirts everywhere & really wanted to try out the trend this fall, but none of the others I've come across were quite worth the price. However, I couldn't pass this up when I found it on the clearance rack at a local Target! The material is super soft yet still holds its shape & I really like the laser cut detail at the bottom. According to the size chart I would be an XS, but I found it to be a tight fit so I went for the S instead. As a result, it hits lower & flares out a bit more than pictured on the model, but overall I am very happy with my purchase & can't wait to wear this!",5
"Wow, what a great value this is. This top is unique, on trend, well made, and very comfortable. I love the faux suede fabric. Very realistic. The cut and style are so fashion forward. I normally wear a women's size medium in tops. Since this is a Junior size I needed a large. Fits true to size. Such a fun top. Can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can wear it with my fall wardrobe.",5
"These are very well made and a steal for the price. The material and stitching are very good quality. They are a darker camel color than the picture and so much cuter in person. If you are petite, they are quite long (nothing a wedge can't fix). I usually wear a medium in this brand but they are a snug fit so I sized up.",5
"I love the COLOR of this shirt - so pretty! I also love that I can dress it up or down - great piece for my closet! In fact, I bought it in the green, as well!",5
"best blouse i own purchased it in every color offered",5
"Love this shirt so much, I bought 2!",5
"You really can't look any cooler than these fancy pants. Yes they're long (in the pic they look ridiculous like highwaters!) I love the way they look pooling around my feet and flapping around while I wear sandals. I'm 5'6. They are casual knit pants meant for a fun relaxed vibe. I love em! They do stretch out as soon as you start wearing them so maybe order a size down. (I wear a 12/14 with a big booty, and the XL was way too big)",5
"I so love this top! Only wish there were other color/print combos and I would buy them all. This is a nice quality top but it does take some care. Cold wash - gentle cycle = hang dry. Looks awesome with denim and black boots.",5
"I loved this top. It had vibrant fall like colors and was very loose and flowy. (Next size down would be appropriate) this shirt would have had at least 4 stars if the sleeve didnt rip in the first wash. It ripped on the top part of the arm as the fabric couldnt withstand washing. This shirt is a waste of money unless you handwash and dry.",5
"I purchased this on clearance and am happy with the top. It's a very very thin material but a brillant orange color which is what I wanted. It runs a bit large and is very flowy....if that's a word!",5
"Very cute, I got a lot of comments on this skirt. I paired it with Target's 3/4 boat-neck plain black top, and everyone thought it was a dress!",5

"I've been using the Boppy Tummy Support Band and am amazed at the relief it has given me! The hot/cold pearls that fit in the back pocket helped relieve my back pain. The Band is able to be pulled pretty snug, so you can really feel the heat or cold of the pearls. It also helped support my tummy in front. I didn't wear it to the store one day and immediately wished I had because I could feel the difference in my stomach not being supported. \n\nI've tried a couple of other bands with my 1st pregnancy and they were so bulky and itchy. I liked that this band was smooth and couldn't be seen under my clothes and the material is very breathable. A couple minor things I would change about the band would be the tag on the inside. It could just be me because my skin is sensitive but I found it very itchy. I just wore a tank top and put the band over it to help with the tag. Also, if you don't velcro it perfectly and sit down it irritates your belly. Again, wearing the band over the tank top solved that! \n\nI wish I would have had this band with my 1st pregnancy. Overall, it has helped me with a lot of discomfort and I will continue to use it for the rest of my pregnancy. I also prefer sleeping with this band on for support rather than using a body pillow. I'll keep this product in mind for a baby gift for pregnant friends!\n\n[...]\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I am very happy with this Tummy Support Band. However, I bought the S/M first based on my pre-pregnancy size. I was typically a medium, 5'5\",5
"I have to be honest, I did think this support band would help much. I have not really had a problem with back pain during my pregnancies but this one bring my third pregnancy and being a nurse working 12 hour shifts, my back was taking a beating. I started wearing this support band to work and it helped tremendously. Without using the band, I would be in excruciating pain. If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this product expecting to use it mainly for the thera-pearl heat/cold pack (how great is it to have a product that holds the heat/cold in the perfect spot even while you're moving around?), but I've actually ended up using it to help with muscle pain/pulling when I move around. Without it I can't do any shopping because my belly feels like it's tearing after even a short amount of walking (3rd trimester). It helps SO much; I'm so glad I bought it. The only negative I can think of is that I have to make sure that my shirt or the tummy panel of my pants is underneath it or the velcro can irritate my belly.",5

I have not really had a problem with back pain during my pregnancies but this one bring my third pregnancy and being a nurse working 12 hour shifts, my back was taking a beating. I started wearing this support band to work and it helped tremendously. Without using the band, I would be in excruciating pain. If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this belly support as I had backpain and this product helped me a lot! If you need a belly band to relief some pain or to help your heavy belly i definitely recommend it! Its a good deal for this price, and the cold/hot option in the back can be useful too. I agree that it runs a bit big and it can sometimes moves but overall it's a must have in my wardrobe!",5
"I bought this two months ago and it has been a life saver. I work 12 hour shifts and couldn't have survived them without it. Great support!",5
"I wish everything wasn't velcro--but it definitely gets the best fit because of it. This seems to help me balance my belly and I like that it will grow with me! I wear it when I'm standing or walking a lot. Sitting can get uncomfortable if wearing for a long time. The cold/hot insert will be great in the summer--its waiting in my freezer!",5
"I recently ordered upside belly being 33 weeks pregnant and starting to have extreme low back pain which is making everything more challenging. I am 5ft6 and 135 lbs now and was a size 2 prior to pregnacy and found that the size small fit well. Product seems to be made of good quality material but only had a day so far. Ice pack spot is awesome as that is exactly where I need it! Also purchased the full belly leggings in a size s and they are super comfy so far. Very pleased with my purchases and thought the service was easy and fast!!",5
"I have been wearing for a few weeks and can't believe how good the Upsie is! I went one day without it and couldn't believe how much I missed the added support for my growing belly. Keeps the little one off my bladder a bit as well which is really helpful. I am 5'4\",5
"I started having horrible lower back pain around month 6-7 during this pregnancy. I wasn't able to go grocery shopping without being almost crippled and walking like a penguin from hurting so bad. I purchased my band earlier this month, and fell in love! Whenever I have back pain or will be in a situation where I know I will end up with back pain, I put this baby on! It relieves the pain I already have and completely prevents the pain I would usually get.\nWay worth every penny! I tried on at least 10 other brands and this was the most comfortable and showed the least under my clothes:)",5
"The Upsie Belly is the best gifts I've ever received! I'm a petite person and by around 25 weeks, the back pains were becoming more difficult to ignore. Add to that sciatica and soon enough even walking around hurt, every step sent pain from the top of my left hip down to my knee. A friend have me the Upsie Belly and I swear I felt the relief almost immediately. It fit so well under my belly and covered the right amount of my lower back. Having the slight lift of my belly took off so much pressure. The material is soft and didn't irritate my skin the way I've heard some women complain about other brands and it didn't shift around either. I work as a medical assistant so I'm constantly on the move and sitting and getting up, so that was very important for me.",5
"This worked very well with helping to support my belly & back during my pregnancy. The ice pack was great to just to help with the aching back. I used it mostly while working 12 hour shifts but toward the end of my pregnancy I wore it most of the time.",5
"I bought this when I was 22wks pregnant with my second. It is seriously a life saver! My belly and back were so sore after being out and being on my feet for even just an hour. My upsie belly definitely relieved so much of the pressure and made this pregnancy so much better. I recommend it to every pregnant woman who experiences the same discomfort. Totally worth every penny!",5
"I was starting to get back pain due to the big heavy belly...this belt works fabulously. It eases the weight on your back and hips significantly and relieved my pain. Highly recommend it. It's also easy to wash (I wore it during the very hot summer and hand washed it regularly)",5
"I've had terrible back and hip problems with this pregnancy so bad that I had to go to the physical therapy. I put this one and it was immediate relief. I don't have to go to my therapist anymore. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone with back and hip problems!",5
"I purchased this at about 20 weeks hoping it would help relieve the pressure on my legs and veins. I am now at 36 weeks and wear this all the time and I love it!! It has really helped with my comfort and even though my veins are still bad it definitely helps take the pressure off my legs and has prevented back pain. I exercise daily and the upsie belly is great to support my tummy and keep me comfortable. I feel so much better when I wear this and even though it is a bit pricey it has been worth the investment and has held up extremely well.",5
"My mom bought me this after weeks of hearing me complain about back pain while pregnant with my daughter and I love it! It is the most helpful product I've had my entire pregnancy!!",5

"I would recommend to anyone who wants to save money on buying new maternity pants. This really helps make any pants fit. I like that you can use it for jeans and for dressy pants since 2 are with buttons and the others with hooks. I love it great money saver!",5
"I wear a uniform to work and at 10 weeks I'm already busting out of my uniform. I want to wait until I'm in my 2nd trimester to share the news at work, so I bought this in hopes of buying some time until I break the news and can wear civilian clothes. They are awesome and extremely comfortable. I've also used them in my jeans that have gotten a little snug and they work perfectly. Highly recommend!!!!",5
"I should have gotten this so much earlier in my pregnancy. Super easy to use, and let me get back into a few pants I had given up on over a month ago. Currently am 5 months along, and am just now starting to use the longer of the two belts (pre-pregnancy pants size 8). The \",5
"I ordered this for use during that awkward phase of pregnancy where you dont quite fit your old jeans but you're not quite big enough for maternity jeans.  I am barely showing so I used to shortest extender in the package and it worked very well.  While using the extender my zipper stayed up and my jeans still felt like I was wearing them the normal way. I would definitely recommend this to other prego's.",5
"This is a really great product. I am almost 5 months pregnant and it has been wonderful to be able to still wear my pre-pregnancy clothes, and with the different sizes it looks like I might be able to get through the whole pregnancy using this.",5
"This did everything it promised. I used it only for postpartum but i think the entire kit would work especially well for the early weeks of pooching during pregnancy.",5
"Love this belt, it's great for saving money and staying in your current jeans without having to buy ugly maternity pants!",5
"It is very easy to use. I love the fact it can be adjusted throughout your entire pregnancy. Works very well with my jeans and dress pants for work.",5
"I absolutley love this kit!! It works perfectly for those pre pregnancy pants that just barely wont button! I am so excited that they make this!!",5
"This kit comes with belly belts of 2 sizes. I am using the smaller one and love it. It just extends the belt and thats all I need for now. I am wearing my regular jeans and trousers and feel v comfortable. Love it!",5
"Great item to have, instead of buying those expensive, unflattering maternity jeans. Comes in different sizes as your belly grows! Must have!",5
"Is a very usefull piece, you can wear all your clothes whenyou are pregnant and do not fit into pregnancy clothes. I do recommed this product.",5
"This item is a great purchase to make in early pregnancy. If you are a small person and will possibly outgrow your clothes very quickly once your waist stars to thicken, this is a great way to keep being able to wear your pre-pregnancy clothes.",5
"My daughter got these in the mail as a surprise from me. Timing was perfect they were going out to a party and she wasn't showing much but when she went to put on the pants she wanted to wear they were not going to button. She was so happy I had just sent these and she was able to finish dressing in the outfit she planned and was really excited about having these, She loves theim!",5
"This is a great button extender. It stays on, looks good and helped me wear my pre-pregnancy clothes through month 5.",5
"This product offers a great way to fit in regular clothes in the early months of pregnancy. I hope to use it through my pregnancy and since it expands I think I will be able to. This is a great idea and I just love it!!",5
"I really got a lot of use out of the Belly Belt. I bought it when i found out i was pregnant and i was able to keep wearing my work clothes and jeans for six months of my pregnancy. After my son was born i went back to using the Belly Belt instead of wearing the maternity pants for a more comfortable fit. I love that the kit comes with two different size belts and a set with hooks for dress pants!!",5
"This product is great! I use it with all of my jeans! I tell all my friends about this product that is pregnant!",5
"I have three pairs of my favorite Express jeans and thanks to the belly belt I am still able to wear them at 7  mos prego. It is just now starting to wear and tear but I wear it almost every day. I dont use the fabric it came with because its not very useful. [...]",5
"I absolutely love the Belly Belt! It has helped me to stay in my pre-pregnancy jeans comfortably. I have no complaitns whatsoever",5
"This belly band is a life saver so far. I am in my second trimester & so far the belly band is holding up pretty well. I'm hoping the belly band works well into my last trimester so that I can wear my jeans a little longer instead of shopping for maternity pants.",5
"I am now 15 weeks pregnant with my second child and have just purchased a Belly Belt. It is seriously the best maternity purchase I have ever made.I am still wearing my pre-pregnancy jeans and plan to for the remainder of my pregnancy, with Belly Belt.I find the belts and material really handy - they pull my jeans together while giving me that extra bit of room and I have used the maternity a couple of times, I found it to sit very well.Great Buy... recommend to everyone.",5
"This is my second pregnancy and my how I wish I would have found this with the first one! I used the belly band during my first pregnancy and I saw the belly belt this time around and had to give it a try. This thing is AMAZING! I am 14 weeks and very small framed (size 0) and this is perfect for all of my pre pregnancy jeans, shorts and slacks. It is not bulky at all and you can't even tell that I am wearing it, even under tighter shirts. I would highly recommend this to any mom to be!!",5
"I am very petite and had enough trouble finding pants to fit before I got pregnant. Having the Belly Belt is a life saver!!! Hopefully the two sizes will get me through my entire pregnancy so that I won't even have to buy maternity pants! I would recommend this product to anyone that is pregnant! It will save you a ton of money in the long run!!",5
"ok!!! so- I am now 8 months pregnant and still wearing my regular clothes. I am by no means a small pregnant woman. My belly is huge and I wear a size 14 pant (pre-pregnancy) and am still wearing them thanks to the Belly Belt! Really- I have saved a ton of money because I did not have to buy new professional clothing to wear to work, I just use the belly belt in my slacks and wear longer (maternity) shirts to cover the fact that my zipper is down. I will say though- I do not like the inserts that come with the belt- they just ride up and come out- so I just leave my zipper down(no one can see it anyways) I am still giving this product 5 stars though! Great invention!",5
"I am 22 weeks now and I simply love this! If my blouse is long enough, i wear it on its own, or else I will slide on a belly band to cover up. Recommended for all pregger ladies!",5
"I have both this belly band and the blanket from Belly Armor. I love them both, as the really do prevent radiation (I tried the cell phone test several times). I use the blanket all the time at home, and the band when I'm out, especially when traveling. I've also started buying them as gifts for my mommy-to-be friends.",5
"When using a hip bandit place the belly shield low enough to cover your incision.\nWorks well to keep excess skin in place when putting on a belly bandit.\nExcellent for reminding you to keep better posture without causing discomfort.",5
"I'm happy I bought this to wear under my Belly bandit! Definitely made it more comfortable.",5
"I bought this after finding out I had to have a c-section with my twin girls. I gained 70 pounds and already lost 50 in the two weeks my girls have been born. Not to mention I have been able to up and moving the same day I had my c-section! I recommend this product to anyone who wants help recovering and wants to lose their baby weight as quick as possible.",5
"Most of the bad reviews are calling this a belly bandit with poor compression. This goes under the bandit so you can use lotions without getting your bandit dirty. The belly shield does just that although I did find that it slightly yellowed the inside of my belly bandit. Great product to help keep your belly bandit on your belly where it should be.",5
"I bought this to go along with my bandit and I really liked it. It did contain the mess of oils and lotions that I used on my belly. I plan on still using the product with other clothes while moisturizing my stomach and hips. A little pricey, but I am happy I got it.",5

"I bought the original belly bandit before I delivered my son. I have been wearing the medium for a week and I have already lost so much of my belly! I'm going to order the small because the medium is almost too big now and it barely fit right after I gave birth. I only wear it during the day but I find it to be very comfortable. I just wear one of my pregnancy be bands from target under it and it's great! It makes my back feel so much better too when I'm wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone for post pregnancy!",5
"Have been wearing a Large for a week and have already seen a difference. Will be purchasing a smaller size to keep up the momentum. Have received comments that I don't look like I had a baby a week ago. So happy I purchased!",5
"I purchased my bandit 5 weeks pp, unfortunately I had been using a girdle with no results previously. Within 2 weeks I have already lost 4 inches from my waistline! I wish I would have had it sooner!",5

"I purchased my belly bandit original a week prior to my second c section. Going in on the day I had my daughter I had weighed 180 and one month after birth I weighed 148. I put the belly bandit on right after I gave birth (3 hrs or so after.) And it also helped me with breastfeeding support too. It's just all around amazing. I have recommend this to many mothers!",5
"I have bought this twice now. And each time it has done wonders for my recovery after a C-section.",5
"I waited until a couple weeks after my son was born via c-section to start wearing a belly bandit. I wish I would have worn one sooner. It really helped to shrink my uterus and to provide some much needed support after a c-section that I was not prepared for. We are trying to conceive and I will have a new belly bandit on hand before I deliver another child!",5
"I bought this with my first (after a painful first few weeks) and all I can say is I wish I would have had it from the beginning!",5
"I had a C section on 9/28 and started wearing the band on 10/1. Prior to putting it on, I couldn't climb in bed because it was too high, and getting up off the couch was difficult. Once I put it on, however, I was mobile again! It made me feel so secure and helped with the aches and pains. Plus, it's helping me shrink back down. Bonus! Love love love this product.",5
"I was pregnant with twins, and gained 40 pounds only in my belly. After birth, my abdominal muscles and back muscles were so weak, and I still looked pregnant. I wore the size medium for less than a week, then needed the small. Within days I could Velcro the small to its tightest levels and that provided the support I needed to flatten my tummy and provide back support. I enjoy wearing it and it gives an extra level of confidence. I also have the belly shield, but I prefer to wear th bandit over a fitted tank under my shirt. I'm back to a size 4 only two weeks after twins, and at my pre-pregnancy weight and feel like I look pretty good! :)",5
"It is comfortable to wear and cant see it under clothes. This is my 2nd c section and it has made a huge difference helping my tummy go down. I wish I would've bought one with my first baby! The only complaint I would have would be wishing that the length of the belly bandit was longer and covered my whole torso and not just the bottom part but overall great product and worth the money!",5
"I have only been using this for a couple weeks but can already tell a difference (compared to my last delivery where I didnt use anything after). I do wear it day and night. I was concerned it wouldnt be comfortable but it really is. I put it on the day after deliver and it helped my abdominal area feel less achy because the BB is squishing it all back in place :)",5
"I had a great experience with the belly bandit! I was given another stretchy wrap around support after my c-section and I definitely preferred the belly bandit! You can see both under clothes, but you just had a baby! Give your self some slack :) I liked the belly bandit more than the other one because it gave incredible back support! I will definitely try this again with our next pregnancy!",5
"I bought this product right before delivery because I wanted to have it at hand! This is by far the best product I've ever used for my tummy. I will let my before n after photos do the talking. I will recommend this product to all my pregnant friend for postpartum recovery success!",5
"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5

"I love the quality, print, and fit if the shirt...must have staple piece this fall",5
"comfortable fit and washes well",5
"Fits comfortably. I love the overall look. Perfect with leggings and boots.",5
"Loved the shirt - I sized up so it would be a little longer and looser. Very soft!",5
"The material of this shirt is very comfortable, washes without wrinkling and fits perfect. I am 60 years old and I ordered size L and it fits perfect. I have received several compliments on this shirt.",5
"I ADORE this shirt! Every time I wear it I get so many compliments. I love the 2 tone of it- its actually double layered so when you fold the sleeves its different on the other side. Its extremely comfortable. I found it to be very true to size. For info- I am 5'4\",5
"I LOVE this shirt!! It's super comfy and I love the checkered pattern that shows when you roll up the sleeves. I wish they had other colors b/c I would def pick up more!",5
"I'm 5'5\",5
"I'm 5'7\",5
"5'7'' 120lbs, ordered the extra small. Very flattering will look nice with jeans and maybe a skirt. Glad to have a nice thin blouse for summer wear!",5
"This is my fourth or fifth Merona top - I have the tees, tanks, sweaters, etc. I love the blend of Rayon cotton a tiny bit of spandex. Thanks again - these are such a value at full price that when they are marked down, it's almost a gift!",5
"I love this shirt, but I recommend getting a size up because it shrinks a lot in the dryer.",5
"Love this shirt. Very very soft flannel. Bought a second one. Longer so it looks great with leggings and boots.",5
"Perfect fit, great quality!",5
"I love this shirt! It's a lighter weight fabric (not a heavy denim) and is a nice long length, so it looks great paired with leggings and boots. It's loose and flowy, but not too boxy. I am 5'10\",5
"I saw this shirt in store, but they didn't have my size. I called several stores in the area and no one had it. Ended up ordering online a couple times and finally got it. I like it because it looks like denim, but is softer and doesn't wrinkle. For reference, I ordered a M. I'm 5'7'' and 140 lbs. Fit is great, maybe a bit long, but it looks cute with a tuck or half tuck.",5
"I didn't try on this shirt before I purchased it and luckily it fit very well.",5
"This top is great looking and trend right. Tunic length can be paired with leggings or tucked in with the denim on denim look. Runs a little small under the arms, had to size up one size.",5
"I found this online, but probably wouldn't have looked twice at it in the store once I saw it in person. It fits well and is very cute on. I bought a size small, but normally wear an extra small in a button up in this brand. The extra small was too tight across the back. Great purchase to wear with boots and leggings.",5
"LOVE this denim shirt!!!! Very happy!!!!",5
"Nice surprise. Order, arrived, fits perfect. So comfortable. Love the color. Warm.",5
"Ive been looking for this color shirt since last season...as usual, Target always has the hottest trends at awesome prices!",5
"Great to pair with bright colored maxi skirt for spring & summer",5
"These are the softest pants I've ever put on. Incredible! Very light as well.",5
"Very flattering. Perfect length. Not too high-waisted, but high-waisted enough. Pictures don't do it justice.",5
"I was quite happy when I saw it. Look so much cuter than the picture. Definitely recommend.",5
"Pale lavender almost pink, and a dark purple almost navy. Gorgeous color. Great length. Love it",5
"I've been seeing faux suede skirts everywhere & really wanted to try out the trend this fall, but none of the others I've come across were quite worth the price. However, I couldn't pass this up when I found it on the clearance rack at a local Target! The material is super soft yet still holds its shape & I really like the laser cut detail at the bottom. According to the size chart I would be an XS, but I found it to be a tight fit so I went for the S instead. As a result, it hits lower & flares out a bit more than pictured on the model, but overall I am very happy with my purchase & can't wait to wear this!",5
"I love this dress. I'm about 5'3-5'4, 118lbs, usually a size 2-4 and usually a small in the juniors department but i got this in an xs and it fits perfectly. The bottom just barely touches the floor with flats on, so it might not be good for really tall girls.",5
"love, love, love these!\nvery flattering, looks like ultra suede.",5
"I just bought this less than an hour ago. Vintage style, great fit as if it was tailored just for me. Bought it in a large since my bust size, yet still very fitted around my waist. Fabric is soft against skin and the price was a steal.",5
"I love this dress! I almost didn't try it on in the store because it looked so drab on the hanger. However I put it on and is actually a very flattering dress. It provides a classic shape. And just like the other review I tend to be a bit bigger in the bust so the stretchy fabric gives enough to where I didn't have to go up a size to fit my chest and then be too big in the hips. I have worn it twice and have received a lot of compliments on it. Definitely can't be shy wearing it either. The bold pattern is unique and passes as a vintage chic dress.",5
"This style is easy and flowy but elegant. Highly recommend.",5
"I was hesitant to give this 5 stars, only because the sizing is off. But everything else makes it worth it! I normally wear an XL, but needed a XXL. It's a nice thick, soft fabric that's so comfortable! As a curvier girl I have trouble finding dresses like this that flatter my mid-section, but this looks great!",5
"I so love this top! Only wish there were other color/print combos and I would buy them all. This is a nice quality top but it does take some care. Cold wash - gentle cycle = hang dry. Looks awesome with denim and black boots.",5
"I loved this top. It had vibrant fall like colors and was very loose and flowy. (Next size down would be appropriate) this shirt would have had at least 4 stars if the sleeve didnt rip in the first wash. It ripped on the top part of the arm as the fabric couldnt withstand washing. This shirt is a waste of money unless you handwash and dry.",5
"Super soft and super cute!",5
"I've been using the Boppy Tummy Support Band and am amazed at the relief it has given me! The hot/cold pearls that fit in the back pocket helped relieve my back pain. The Band is able to be pulled pretty snug, so you can really feel the heat or cold of the pearls. It also helped support my tummy in front. I didn't wear it to the store one day and immediately wished I had because I could feel the difference in my stomach not being supported. \n\nI've tried a couple of other bands with my 1st pregnancy and they were so bulky and itchy. I liked that this band was smooth and couldn't be seen under my clothes and the material is very breathable. A couple minor things I would change about the band would be the tag on the inside. It could just be me because my skin is sensitive but I found it very itchy. I just wore a tank top and put the band over it to help with the tag. Also, if you don't velcro it perfectly and sit down it irritates your belly. Again, wearing the band over the tank top solved that! \n\nI wish I would have had this band with my 1st pregnancy. Overall, it has helped me with a lot of discomfort and I will continue to use it for the rest of my pregnancy. I also prefer sleeping with this band on for support rather than using a body pillow. I'll keep this product in mind for a baby gift for pregnant friends!\n\n[...]\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I am very happy with this Tummy Support Band. However, I bought the S/M first based on my pre-pregnancy size. I was typically a medium, 5'5\",5
"I have to be honest, I did think this support band would help much. I have not really had a problem with back pain during my pregnancies but this one bring my third pregnancy and being a nurse working 12 hour shifts, my back was taking a beating. I started wearing this support band to work and it helped tremendously. Without using the band, I would be in excruciating pain. If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this product expecting to use it mainly for the thera-pearl heat/cold pack (how great is it to have a product that holds the heat/cold in the perfect spot even while you're moving around?), but I've actually ended up using it to help with muscle pain/pulling when I move around. Without it I can't do any shopping because my belly feels like it's tearing after even a short amount of walking (3rd trimester). It helps SO much; I'm so glad I bought it. The only negative I can think of is that I have to make sure that my shirt or the tummy panel of my pants is underneath it or the velcro can irritate my belly.",5

"I bought this belly support as I had backpain and this product helped me a lot! If you need a belly band to relief some pain or to help your heavy belly i definitely recommend it! Its a good deal for this price, and the cold/hot option in the back can be useful too. I agree that it runs a bit big and it can sometimes moves but overall it's a must have in my wardrobe!",5
"I bought this two months ago and it has been a life saver. I work 12 hour shifts and couldn't have survived them without it. Great support!",5
"I wish everything wasn't velcro--but it definitely gets the best fit because of it. This seems to help me balance my belly and I like that it will grow with me! I wear it when I'm standing or walking a lot. Sitting can get uncomfortable if wearing for a long time. The cold/hot insert will be great in the summer--its waiting in my freezer!",5
"I bought these pants in store and I love them. I am 5'1\",5
"I love these pants. They are super soft and plenty thick, unlike many other leggings I've tried. The small fit great. I'm normally a 4-6 pre-pregnancy and about 5'7\",5
"I really like how the material is heavier than most spandex leggings. It doesn't show every single bump & lump and will provide a little more warmth. The material is 76% polyester, 20% rayon, and 4% spandex. I'm 22 weeks, 129lbs, 5'5\",5
"Fits very nice! I normally wear small, but bought this in XS. Love that the V-neck isn't too low!",5
"These are super comfy and opaque. They are exactly what i was looking for! I bought 2 pairs!",5
"Super comfortable and slimming. The perfect combination after you have a baby!",5
"I have 5 of these tanks in various colors. I am a 36DD pre-pregnancy and even larger while nursing. An XL was a good fit for me. They are quite low cut, so I don't wear them out unless it is underneath another shirt.",5
"It's long enough and not too low cut. It's stretchy and gives you a bit of compression which is exactly what you need after having a baby.",5
"I love this cami. The fabric is really smooth, stretchy and soft. The clip down feature works really well for me and I wear this under my clothes most all of the time right now. It makes nursing so much easier. I also really like the slimming factor. It made my clothes look nicer right after I have birth because it helped to smooth everything out. The price is a little expensive but I will pay it because I do like this cami. I am a 42 DD and the XL works for me. It is fitted",5
"This is perfect for wearing around the house or out under another top.",5
"I bought this first to feel like my belly was more supported. I am already having some \",5
"I'm only 5 ft tall and it's hard to find pants that fit well.  This band has allowed me to stay in my \",5
"I started to grow out of my pants at about 3 months, I'm at 8 months now and this maternity band is still going strong. Maternity pants can be expensive, this was a great alternative.",5
"Love it! Able to fit in my pre-mat clothes still at 22 weeks, with a little waistband help from the bellaband!",5
"My wife bought this and has found it very useful. Good Product and Value.",5
"This is perfect for filling in some extra space between your pants and your shirt. It also helps with keeping pants that are too big up or just smoothing out that section a little bit.",5
"I actually think this bra is comfortable. I am a DD and despite not having underwire this bra still gives me enough support. I liked this bra enough, I bought it again.",5
"I bought these 3 days ago and never want to take them off. I'm 7 months pregnant, pre-pregnancy size 8 pants, and the S/M size fits me perfectly. They don't squeeze too tight or fall down. I plan on wearing them all winter to stay warm and I'm sure they'll come in handy post-partum as my body heals and I want some belly coverage.",5
"I am really happy with these leggings. I was nervous because the biggest size offered was a M/L, when in pre-pregnancy I am a size 16 pant, but they fit amazing! They are super comfortable and soft, I feel like I could wear them all the time. They do fall down a little at the top, but since, as a pregnant woman, I use the restroom every few hours, I just adjust them then. This has been my best maternity clothes purchase so far! I'm 20 weeks, so I hope these fit till the end, cause they are great!",5
"Soft stretchy material. They do not cut into the top of my stomach like most leggings if I decide to wear full panel and don't hurt my lower abdomen if I wear them under my bump either. Every pregnant girl should get a pair (or two) of these. I plan to wear these post pregnancy as well. This time around, I'll be prepared with comfy clothes to wear in the hospital and around the house after delivery and these definitely make the cut. Enjoy!",5
"Funny story-- I saw this on my friend at her baby shower and I had been looking for some opague comfy leggings for under dresses and what not (hate tights). Did I mention I am not even pregnant? These are awesome-- thick and warm and I just folded over the top of the pant like a yoga pant. I have since bought three more! Definitely recommend this to anyone!",5
"Tried these on at the store and fell in love. Soft fabric and opaque enough to wear a shorter top. Love that they are not constricting even when you bend or sit for awhile. Pre-pregnancy I was a 6 so I went with the smallest size. Many reviews stated that they would fall down, but I haven't had that problem. I'll definitely use these after my pregnancy.",5
"I'm about a size 18 or 15 pre pregnancy. I got the Large and they are perfect! I do not have a problem with them falling down. I haven't noticed them being see through either. I'm currently 6 months pregnant. They are pretty long. I'm 5'7 and they go all the way to my ankle .",5
"so happy I purchased these leggings - they are the most comfortable pregnancy accessory I have so far!  They are great to wear with skirts/dresses or with a tshirt when hanging out around the house - super comfortable!  I'm 5'5\",5
"I've had a terrible time finding maternity pants or leggings that fit me well (aren't too saggy, always sliding down, too tight around the belly, etc). I'm 5'8\",5
"Absolutely love these! I'd definitely recommend for pregnancy as well as post-pregnancy! Very comfy and great for recovery from c-section!",5
"Love these! Extra band at top for belly support and they are thick enough to not be see thru! I am 22 weeks now, 5'5 and weighing 173...ordered a medium and they fit perfectly.",5
"Pre pregnancy I was a size 10, 170 lbs, 57, i tried on small medium and medium large and although the sm fit well, i felt that they were see through, the ml also fit and werent as stretched out so were more opaque and less see through, i bought the ml and LOVE the softness and versatility of these leggings. Ill admit they do slip a little but not enough that i have to wear my belly band with it. The leggings do feel like they dont goall the way up my crotch area but after readjusting in the bathroom they are fine, since were there every half hour. Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons to these leggings, i ended up buying a second pair, i gave it four stars because they do slip a bit. I wish they came in different colors.",5
"I am one of the people who love these! I find that they are not too tight on my belly and don't press my bladder along with everything else. I do see how some can say they do not stay up all the way, but it does not bother me, it's not like they are falling off at all. As far as other people saying they are see through I do not agree. Perhaps they need a bigger size because it's stretched to the fullest. I find these comfortable, and not too tight. I don't like when I'm being squeezed too hard by pants! I have worn these a few times-and can see myself wearing them all throughout my pregnancy. I wish I had these with my last pregnancy! Good luck to all those searching for some decent leggings... I would highly recommend these or at least give them a try! I am a size 6 and 4mos. small fits perfectly.",5
"These leggings are amazing.......so soft and comfy...AND they actually look adorable on too =) I'm 5 months along with my 5th and always avoided buying maternity leggings before, but I couldn't resist these, they are just that comfy! I'm pretty petite (5'2\",5
"Love them!! They aren't see through like many other leggings I've bought, and they are super comfy!",5
"I'm 5\",5
"Maternity is hard to shop for online, so I did need to exchange the size, in store, but other then that they are the best quality leggings I have ever seen or owned. You can tell they will last a while, and they are very smooth and comfortable. I do not plan on putting in the dryer and recommend not, since I can tell it'll shrink and you want a perfect tight fit to begin with.",5
"I bought a pair a few weeks ago and I'm buying another pair today. I'm 34 weeks and packing my hospital bag - these are a must have for that. I can't part with my other pair until delivery so I must have two. Overall, great leggings - very comfy!!",5
"I opened the package and first thought that they were too small and not worth the money. Then I tried them on and literally heaved a deep sigh. They are amazingly comfortable, soft, and stretchy. Most leggings either don't stretch enough, or stretch too much and are see through. I think they are only see through on people that bought a too small size. I imagine I wear these everyday towards to end of pregnancy, to/from home from the hospital etc.",5
"I really like this shirt! Material and style are very flattering, roughed sides and super soft material. I ordered a large which is what I normally wear in regular shirts and this maternity shirt has room for my growing belly. I would say runs a tad big.",5
"I love this tank top! I have one in black and also a white one. Yes, they are a bit more spendy, but SO worth it! Super stretchy material, and they are long enough to wear with leggings.\nI bought my white one about a year ago, And it's still holding up perfectly, so they are really durable. HIGHLY recommend!! [?]",5
"I'm 5'7\",5
"Very comfortable and convenient for nursing. I even like them for support when I'm not nursing. They run small though!",5
"Best nursing hrs i own.,. The best feature is the adjustable band, especially since my ribs are large and I can never find a large enough width. The material is very comfortable and soft. Best purchase I made for nursing bras!",5
"I own 7 of these Tanks in Black I love them. I weigh 245lbs and I am not pregnant but I love the fit of these.Perfect!",5
"I picked these up in-store today.  I don't know why online they aren't just called \",5
"I live in Chicago and wanted a thick legging to wear for the winter. This is perfect, almost as thick as a pant but still the look of leggings. I got the small and am 5'4 so they are a bit long, and the belly panel is loose for me at 20wks. I use the Bumped Cami to help keep them tight and have gotten so many compliments on them. Only have washed a few times so not sure how well they will hold up. Have been turning them inside out so hopefully they wont pill like other reviewers have mentioned.",5
"Every pregnant woman should have a pair of these. In fact, they should come in five different colors. They are so comfortable that once you wear them, you'll realize there is NO point to wearing uncomfortable khaki pants as a pregnant lady.",5
"These are great pants, especially for the price. They are a nice thick legging, so they're warm for winter and not see through at all. I ordered a small and they're a little big for me (for reference, I'm 27 weeks pregnant, 5'4\",5
"These are great! I just bought them today and they are super comfy!! I usually don't wear leggings but I like these enough to wear them :)",5
"These pants are wonderful.  I'm 24 weeks and finally decided to break down and buy a pair of pants as my pre-pregnancy ones are too uncomfortable now.  It's a huge difference! I wish I would have bought them sooner! I like my pants to fit a little tight, I am 5'3'' and usually wear a 4/6 before pregnancy. I had to get an XS in these and I'm glad I did.  They tend to slip down a little throughout the day.",5
"Perhaps Liz Lange updated these pants since the last reviewers tried them, but these are by far the greatest maternity pants I've had. They're extremely comfortable and look great dressed up or dressed down. They do pill a little bit, but I think in my case it's from such constant washing and wearing, so that's to be expected. I'm usually a small-medium pre-pregnancy, and I bought these pants in a small. I would recommend sizing down (I may try an XS for a second pair) because the band tends to loosen a bit and will slide down somewhat easily. Other than that, these are the greatest maternity pants!",5
"Like wearing sweat pants to work! Very comfortable, great for the later stages of pregnancy.",5
"I can't say enough good things about these leggings! They fit great, they are super comfortable, are good quality, and they don't fall down!! Couldn't be happier--highly recommend.",5
"Very comfortable and convenient for nursing. I even like them for support when I'm not nursing. They run small though!",5
"This is the best nursing bra ever! It has the right amount of coverage, holds things in place nicely. It was my absolute favorite, and i had purchased 6!!!",5
"Fits perfectly and feels very comfortable. I love that it is easy to open.",5
"Super comfortable and slimming. The perfect combination after you have a baby!",5
"I have 5 of these tanks in various colors. I am a 36DD pre-pregnancy and even larger while nursing. An XL was a good fit for me. They are quite low cut, so I don't wear them out unless it is underneath another shirt.",5

"For all nursing moms, this is a must have. I don't know why I waited so long to get it. But let me tell you, it makes life so much easier! Trust me, you won't regret it. As for size, I'm a 36 D. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.",5
"I pump exclusively, since my bebe refuses to latch, and I finally caved in and bought this hands-free bra. For someone like me, who spends anywhere from 2-3 hours a day pumping, I feel like this is a must-have. It is excellent for sitting and working at the computer. The quality seems to be good, but I just started using it so I can't speak for the long term. I followed the sizing guide and purchased a medium, which has worked perfectly. (I was a 32 DD pre-pregnancy.) I could wish the pump slots were slightly farther apart, but it still works fine. The first time I used it I tried without a nursing bra underneath and I haven't attempted to do so again, due to the difficulty I experienced in safely removing everything without fear of spilling. I have gotten better at taking it off afterwards. I'd say that's the only trouble I've had with this purchase, and it's probably just me being a goon. This definitely makes for a better pumping experience--highly recommend!",5
"I don't know how I used to pump without this bra.  I can now pump and work at the same time or just read a magazine.  The bra itself is very comfortable and fits perfectly.  I would recommend it to anyone who pumps.",5
"Bought this because I couldn't figure out how to have five hands to hold the breast pump in place and help express my milk during pumping. This solved my problem. Can also multi-task while wearing. Good size based on chart. Definite recommend!!",5
"The bustier does what it claims. I wear a 36-38 C while nursing and the large is a good fit for me. It's comfortable but not too big. My hands are free while pumping.",5
"This is a great product and I recommend it to any new mom that is breastfeeding/pumping.",5
"This is a must have for pumping. It makes pumping a lot easier. I can see myself using this a lot in the future.",5
"i cant imagine pumping without this. allows you to be hands free, use laptop, eat, etc. it is good to have more than one so that you have a spare when one is in the wash.",5
"At first I wasn't sure about getting one of these. But I ended up pumping exclusively with my son and wanted someway to be able to multi task while pumping. Although this thing isn't perfect, it certainly does a good job for the price. It fits a little snug but I imagine it has to or it would slide off... it is just a tube top after all. Its comfortable enough for what it is but I will have to see how long it lasts.",5
"This is a must have if you double pump. I found it hard holding with my hands and turning pump on and off. Great quality. I ordered a size up just because I didnt want it to tight and cause restriction. I think regular size would have been fine also.",5
"Very effective and helpful in double pumping.    Good value for the money you spend. Can store in pumping bag and does not take up much room.",5
"[...]  Once I returned to work I used this bra (borrowed from a friend) and I can't imagine pumping without it!  I do not enjoy pumping at all, so being able to do it hands free allows time to pass much more quickly.  I am able to eat lunch, work on my computer, and even write this review as I pump!  My one issue is the zipper - sometimes when I zip it up the bottom comes apart.  Not a big deal, I just unzip it and try again.",5
"Such a simple idea but works so well. This changed my life as far as hands free pumping. The bra is sturdy and holds the pump parts yet is comfortable. The material is not made cheaply. It also seems to make pumping more comfortable.",5
"I knew this would be helpful but I couldn't imagine how much. Our baby ended up in the NICU for 4 weeks so I pumped using this every 3 hours for 4 weeks! It is still useful now that I'm at home and back to work and can get things done while I'm pumping!",5
"I am a 38D with my milk in full supply and I ordered a Large.  Had I been any bigger (and despite their size chart) this bustier would not have fit me.  I would recommend this product to any new mom planning to return to work & needing to pump...or just wanting 2 free hands!",5
"This item is great! It is the best hands free option. I would suggest buying the size that you were in pre-pregnancy. I would normally wear a medium in clothes and ordered this in a Large. Now that I am back to my normal size it is too big on me. It is kind of expensive for what it is though.",5
"I really like this product, but I had to return it the first time I ordered it because it did not fit me.  I am 34 A/B and S was too small for me, but M is just right.  I am probably lucky that the distance between my nipples is the same as the distance between the holes in the bra, but I suspect this will not be the case for everyone.  Overall, it is very functional.",5
"I was so excited to find this in my local Target! I exclusively pump, so I spend a lot of time pumping. Being able to feed and change baby, clip coupons, make grocery lists, read books, etc. while pumping makes my life SO much easier. Unfortunately, within a couple of weeks, the seam started to tear a little, so there is a superficial hole in the top of it. I really should have purchased the next size up. I'm currently a 40DD and purchased a large.It was the only one in the store, though, so I snatched it while I could. I highly suggest this product!",5
"Makes pumping life SO much easier. I would've stopped pumping long before without this bra.  Was 32B pre-baby, 34C post baby and ordered small.  A little tight at first but you want it tight because it will stretch out a bit and you need it tight in order to keep the pump suctioned and for it to stay up.",5
"Buster runs small so buy one size bigger than you think. Also if you can sew at all add a hook at the top so you don't break your zipper. A wonderful accessory. I highly recommend it!",5
"Makes pumping a lot easier. I only wore when pumping to have hands free. The zipper gets stuck but the amount that I use it that is to be expected. I bought several of these between 2 kids.",5
"I was very hesitant to buy at first. All the reviews I read were about broken zippers but I've had no issues. I had a five dollar off coupon that had come in the Madella breast pump that I bought. \",5
"I used this 3 times a day for a year - it was a life saver and held up through many washes and daily abuse. Never had issues with the zipper and found the item to be great quality. Don't know what I would've done without it!",5
"I absolutely LOVE this bustier! I didn't buy one/use one with my first child & pumping time and I don't know how I survived without it. This has made pumping at work so much easier for me. It fits easily under my clothes and allows me to continue working while pumping for my baby!",5
"I purchased this item for my daughter. She loved it as it has allowed her freedom to pump and also do other things at the same time.",5
"Ordered this for my girlfriend and she says it's a life saver!!",5
"I bought this because I was falling asleep while pumping. It works so awesome and I can do other things while pumping instead of doze off. Great Idea!",5
"Couldn't pump without this! Definitely need to purchase this if you plan on pumping!",5
"I pumped every 2 hrs while my son was in the NICU for almost a week and did not have this product, my husband just bought me this 2 weeks ago and now I have no clue how I did without it for so long! Seriously, it's worth the money!!!",5
"If you are serious about pumping and plan on doing it for a while I would recommend this. I did it for about 1 moth w/o this and pumping double was hard, unless my husband was there it start the pump for me. Now that I have this life is much easier on my own. It does fit smaller than a normal bar, so I would go up 1 size to be on the safe side.",5
"This bustier completely frees your hands so that you can do other things (like feed your child a bottle, answer the phone, check email) while you're pumping. The quality is good and it's easy to wash.  I plan to purchase one in black, as well.",5
"Love it!  It works great while freeing up your hands for other things!",5
"It completely does its job for being hands free. It also fits for plus size woman comfortably. The only thing I don't like is the wholes in the bra can be seem through your shirt so you have to wear another bra over. Works great for what I needed it for.",5
"This has got to be the greatest invention ever! I have used this 3 times so far and all 3 times have been great! I wear a 38C and the large fits perfect. I now feel like i have much more time whereas before I had to pump 1 breasted at a time because I could not hold both at the same time. I use mine with my lansinoh pump. I definately reccommend this to any mom that is pumping.",5
"I am a 40DDD and have tried many different nursing bras and this is the best! It is super comfortable! It holds everything in, like a sports bra, so if you are looking for more of a lift this isn't the one, but for comfort and firm support you'll love it!!",5
"most comfortable nursing bra I've tried so far. I was severely engorged during my 1st week postpartum and this bra was a God send. The material is so soft and stretchy. I'm currently a 38DD and have trouble finding comfortable supportive nursing bras, this one is true to size and surprisingly supportive.",5
"I'm normally a 38 DD and I went with the XL. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and everything I read about this bra is true. Not the most supportive but comfortable, true to size, and perfect for lounging around the house feeding a baby while recovering from a c section which is what I will be doing! I highly recommend this bra!",5
"I had a nursing bra from my last baby and it was falling apart because it was my \",5
"40DD and this bra in XL was perfect. Had to return others to get this one in another color--wish there were more color choices! Nice support, comfortable material and easy operation of access panels. This is THE bra to get, especially for large busts!",5
"This nursing bra is more comfortable than the sleep nursing bras I ordered. Not really enough support or \",5
"Didn't think I needed a nursing bra (thought I was special for some reason). Its super comfortable and highly recommend it!",5
"As heavy chested woman I was skeptical about how this bra would fit, but being 8 months pregnant you go more for comfort than looks. It fits perfectly and I am now comfortable to go about my day without the discomfort of normal bras.",5
"I love this bra. I currently have five and between nursing two children (one for 15m and one for 11m now) I have worn out five. Eventually the clasps in the back come apart on all the bras, but other than that I don't have any complaints.\nThe bra is the most comfortable I've found for nursing and pumping. I've tried multiple styles and brands. I've purchased from target, soma, and motherhood maternity and these are the best.its comfy enough to wear day and night.\nI have size large and I'm a 36 DDD. They stretch out a bit and need to be washed to tighten back up.",5
"This was given as a gift to me and I love it! Comfort and easy wear makes me forget there maternity bottoms!",5
"Finally, a bra that fits and supports my large chest and has secure clips/straps for nursing. Also has great coverage. Highly recommend!",5
"After 3 months of nursing my first baby, it was time to find a more supportive, well-fitting bra. I've been wearing the Bravado Basics since delivery, and love them, but they aren't supportive enough for everyday wear.\n\nBased on international measurements, I should be a 42C (but I've yet to find a brand that fits in that size). However, I am a 38 D/E in this bra. Since it comes with a band extender, I can get the perfect fit. It offers great support and isn't restrictive at all -- the cups are very stretchy. I was able to try this on in a maternity store, which I would absolutely recommend. Or at least try several sizes, up and down from your measured size, to get it right.\n\nI don't understand why more people aren't writing positive reviews. I've had several nursing moms recommend this bra to me, which is why I bought one before, and now I'm back for two more!",5
"very comfortable for night and day wear. I think it provides good support without cutting in to my shoulders",5
"I bought this over two years ago and it's held up very, very well! I highly recommend this.",5
"I tried, at least, 5 different/brands of nursing tanks...ranging from this price and higher...this Gilligan O'Malley tank isy ultimate fave.\nSoft fabric and fits well w. my clothes.\n\nNote : I, also, wear a nursing bra.",5
"Great product!!!  I have one in every color.  They could use a little more support for the girls but other than that no complaints.  Makes it easy to feed my son when traveling.",5
"Great through and through. Reviewed the white cami, same product just different colour.\n\nOnce wearing it, the colour seems to stretch in this particular cami.",5
"I love these nursing camis. I first received one as a gift and fell in love. I own 5 now hoping to buy the last two colors soon. You can dress them up or down and it makes nursing in public easier for you and baby also more accessible",5
"This bra is worth every penny! It fits very true to size. It offers great coverage for the plus size woman.",5
"The bra is a must for pumpers! It's made just right as long as you get the right size. I ordered the large first, which was way, way too big. As long as your bra size is smaller than 40 w/ any cup size, no matter how much expansion you have had due to milk, it will work well! The large is just too large for anyone w/ a size 36 or 38 no matter how large the breast itself. That's all folks.",5
"This is in my top 3 favorite baby-related items I bought.  SO nice to have hands free when pumping.  It makes the time go so much faster to be able to type, text, or multi-task.  Also nice when connecting and disconnecting from the pump to make less of a mess.\n\n\n\nI like this bra in particular because-\n\n1. It can be adjusted as your size changes.  I've been pumping for 8 months and have adjusted it multiple times as I've lost baby weight and it continues to fit well.  I was concerned that there are only two sizes, but between the zipper panel and the velcro in the back, it can cover a huge range of sizes.\n\n2.  Washes well.  I've washed multiple times and I accidentally dried it once with no issues.\n\n3.  Price was very good- comparable to other bras.\n\nAll in all, a VERY worthwhile purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone who is going to pump.",5
"This bustier is great! If you're pumping and don't want to sit there and hold the bottles for 20 mins, you need this. Does not cause leakage. Worked better than expected!",5
"I LOVE this bustier. I wish someone had told me about them sooner. I use it when I am getting ready in the morning. In the 10-15 mins it takes for me to brush my teeth, put on my make up and do my hair, I am able to pump at the same time. I actually do not dread having to pump and think it will work out well when I return to work. A much cheaper solution than the Medela hand's free pump. ;)I would recommend it to anyone who needs to pump",5
"Let's face it, pumping is a huge pain, no matter how motivated and determined you are to make it work. This bra makes a huge difference in comfort level and allowing you to relax a bit - use your computer, read a book, have a snack - whatever you choose to do while you're pumping. Fabric is soft and stretchy, nice quality. Yes, I believe others when they say it's easy to cut one out of a sports bra, but this is well worth the money in my opinion!",5
"I'm using the Medela pump and i love this bra, it is very convince for me. It gives me a lot of flexibility to check my emails or text. The velcro is super good! its very tight, which is good",5
"This bra works great--I am using it right now. I am so happy to not have to sit here and hold the shields while pumping.The fabric is soft and stretchy but snug and it comes with some other accessories I haven't used yet, but I am happy with it the way it is. Woo hoo!",5
"I bought this yesterday since i was only pumping 1 oz per breast. I was getting frustrated and tired. I hated holding the bottles in my hands. I bought the XS-L at the store but was worried about the fit since i am 40D. The adjustable velcro in the back makes it fit amazingly. Its snug enough to hold up the bottles, yet not squeezing me to death. This morning, i pumped 7oz in one sitting. Highly recommend!",5
"Love this bra. Changed my whole experience pumping milk. Has made pumping milk much, much more comfortable. You can work online and get things done with this bra. Its very well made, well designed, and easy to use. I can't say enough about it. You may be reluctant to spend almost $40 on yet another baby related purchase, but I assure you...this is a must have if your a pumping mother. No regrets!",5
"The Lansinoh arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I opened it and it is sooo much better! It has many options for size.  It has extensions and it  works so great I couldn't have designed one any better than this thing. I'm very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints at all. Lansinoh did a great job with this product.",5
"Whoever invented this deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.",5
"I wasn't sure I'd end up using this...like maybe it would be hassle. It is worth every penny, as it is quick and easy to put on and you can save time by doing all kinds of things with your hands while you're pumping...writing, typing, eating, using the TV remote... :)",5
"Absolutly love the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier!!! It is easy to use, comfortable and allows you to do other things while pumping. A must have for breastfeeding moms!!",5
"Buying this product is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Although I am blessed to have a workplace that is very supportive with me having to pump a few times a day, I was always very frustrated that I could not get much work done during those times because I was having to hold up the breast shields. This bra holds the shields securely in place and allows me to keep working while I pump. I couldn't ask for anything more! Such a great purchase!",5
"I am in love with this hands free pump bustier. I wish I had it for my first baby. Pumping before was always awkward. I would always hunch over the horns and I could never get anything done. What I love about this bustier is that you can adjust the size both with the velcro on the back and the zipper panel in the front. I am also able to assist the pumping with massage since I could make it as tight or as loose as I wanted it. The only downside I am able to see is the awkwardness of getting out of it, but that doesn't even compare to the awkwardness of not having it! This is fantastic and this is a total MUST for any pumping mom!",5
"This is the perfect bra for a working, typing, reading mother!!! This is the only bra I have ever bought and my child is a little over 6 months. I started using it when he was about 2 months. I take it to work everyday and use it twice a day 5 days a week. It stays in my Medella backpack. It holds the shields in place for true hands-free pumping. In fact, I am pumping as I am typing this review. I wash it in the washer and hang it up to dry. I only wear it when I am pumping though so I am not sure of its longevity if you wear it as a regular bra on some days. Thankfully, my job has a place I can pump in peace behind a closed door. I do like the fact that it has an adjustable back. I definitely have used it since I have lost about 15 pounds since giving birth (mostly due to exclusively breastfeeding). The only slight issue is that the zipper started to give a bit. I thought it was stripped at one point. But, it is still working. I am considering buying another one in a few more months. But, for the wear and tear and price, this one is holding up well, all things considered.",5
"I wear DDD pre-pregnancy and G while nursing. An XL / Large Plus fits great with room to spare. Material is soft and zipper is easy to use. Great high quality product. Use several times a day and love it!",5
"Just tried this product after reading reviews and I love it! I have the medela pump and this slips right into it. It is really comfortable fabric and it has a velcro piece in the back that is adjustable. It's really nice to not have to hold the pump.",5
"I've been using this bustier for two weeks now, and although I had to adjust to taking the time to put it on and get the pump's flanges perfectly in place before starting, I'm very happy with it now. It's totally worth the initial set-up time because I can wash bottles while I pump, read a book, etc. The bra is highly adjustable and will go much bigger or smaller, which is great because it ensures a very good fit. It's well made and stays put, and it holds up the bottles even when they're full, though I prefer to lean forward and rest them on the counter. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and am so glad I bought it despite our tight budget- this truly was an investment that is paying off!",5
"I bought this bra so I could pump while I typed on the computer.  Works great, I don't get the annoying marks on my arms trying to hold the cups up like I used to.  The bra keeps the cups up so I don't have to hold them at all.",5
"Love this one...easier to put on, better coverage, and better fit. Should have bought this one first!",5
"This fits wonderfully and stays in place. I was skeptical of a bra that was designed to fit women size xs-L but it does! I am xs and it uses strong Velcro to switch sizes. It helps to free up my arms so that I can care for my twins while pumping. Great quality too.",5
"I have only used the bustier a couple times so far, but it was easy to put on and use. Its much easier to pump now that my hands are free.",5
"I'm pumping exclusively to feed my daughter, and this has been a huge help! Its comfortable and allows me to be hands-free while pumping, which adds up to quite a lot of time during the day. I'd highly recommend this!",5
"I just returned to work 1 month ago, and our little guy is now 3 months old. I used to hate pumping with our first son, because I felt like I was wasting so much time at work. Now I welcome pumping as a time to catch up on paperwork or reading. I'm a pediatrician, and I recommend this to friends and patients. Of all of the fancy gear we've accumulated for our little ones, this is my favorite. Absolutely worth the price.",5
"I am currently wearing size 40F bras. I had my doubts about this bra since there were only two sizes to choose from, but it is perfect. There is a large strip of hook and loop fabric for the back and a strip of fabric to zip in front, making it easily possible to customize this bra. I can email and text and even put on makeup while pumping with this bra. I highly recommend this bra for any woman of any size!",5
"Nursing my fist child, I didn't have this, so pumping was such a chore & took a lot of time away from things.  At work, I ended up skipping a session here & there, of which I underestimated the consequences.  I was struggling by 5 months to keep nursing.  With my second child, I learned about this bustier at a pump class and it has made a HUGE difference.  I can pump much more often than I would have without it.  I travel with it, and actually have been able to pump (with a nursing shawl to cover me) at an airport terminal, on an airport shutltle van & actually on the airplane with someone next to me.  I am able to pump hands free and look at pictures of my baby, eat lunch, drive (although not recommended I'm sure), etc.  I've made so much use of my driving time because of this bustier.  I'd say that over 50% of my pumping sessions happen in the car.  It's totally adjustable, can wear over sweaters or just nursing bra.  The adjustability comes in handy when you lose your baby weight or go through seasons.  I can honestly say I have maintained my milk supply because of this bustier.  My 2nd child is 8.5 months old today and no sign of my milk supply diminishing!  I recommend this to everyone I know.  Get one! I couldn't stand pumping the first time around because I felt trapped.  This time around, it's tolerable; just a slight nuisance.  ;)",5
"This is such a great addition to the occasional or every-day pumping mama. I own the Medela Freestyle pump and the clips do not fit with any other bra, especially the bras I purchased. I am very large chested with a small band size and had to put the Medela bra on, strap on all the clips and hold very still, every time I wanted \",5
"LOVE THIS! It's very comfortable and works with Medela just fine. I also have the Medela Pumping Bra and this one is much more comfortable and has stayed up instead of sliding down. I really like how you can adjust the size of it as well! What a great feature!",5
"I am almost exclusively pumping for my newborn daughter, so I'm spending a lot of time pumping. After making lots of messes and getting frustrated trying to do other things while double pumping, I decided to spend the cash and try this out due to the good reviews. I love it! I was worried it might be too small since I am right on the line between a XS/S/M size and a L/XL size, but I am glad I got the smaller size. The extra panel that zips into the front makes it just the right size for my large chest and it holds the pumps firmly to my breasts without leaking. I'm very happy I spent the money - totally worth it.",5
"Love this product! I pump for my LO, and at times I will be pumping while eating, feeding my LO, and maybe on the phone, all at the same time! It used to take me between 30-60 mins to pump, because of this pumping bra, it takes me 15-30 mins tops! The bra is adjustable to your ribcage size, and is not a thick material, so I can still do what I need to do when I have a case of mastitis. Definitely recommend this product!",5
"This bra makes it so comfortable and easy to pump. Before I had this bra I didn't seem to get a lot of milk when I pumped but now that I can search on my phone or play with baby while pumping I seem to get a lot more where my mind is on something else and I am relaxed. Buy this bra if you want to make your life a little easier.",5
"Makes pumping so much easy ,this is a must have I love how I can feed my son or be on the phone while I pump !",5
"Hands free pumping? YES PLEASE!! Do more while you pump! With the hands free bra, I am able to wash all of the bottles and storage supplies while I pump! Become more efficient by maximizing your time!!!",5
"The first few weeks with a newborn are overwhelming, and it seems we can barely find time to do anything other than pump and breastfeed. With this bra I was able to do something so basic-EAT! It seems silly, but when you have a newborn multi-tasking is your best friend. I loved my bra and even got one for my sister in law. The bra is so well adjusted and ensures a secure fit so you don't lose and of that liquid god.",5
"I am a mother of 3 and am always multi-tasking. With this bra I am able to have both hands free to fold laundry and even eat dinner! It is extremely comfortable and fully adjustable! I recommend this hands-free pumping bra for nursing/pumping moms, no matter what size your bust!",5
"I used this when my son was a newborn. Super easy to use and a nice tool. Fits perfectly!",5
"I own two of these simple wishes hands free pumping bras! I love them and make pumping so much easier and convenient;. The bra is very comfortable too and can be adjusted to fit your body. I tried multiple brands before finding this one and am so glad I did. It has made pumping a breeze and makes my nighttime routine so much easier. I highly recommend this pumping bra to anyone! The bra is flexible, the material is so soft, it fits your breasts nicely the way the fabric fits the curves of the body, the bra is adjustable to your body time (all the other brands I tried did not), and it makes my life much easier when I'm pumping.",5
"its very easy to use!",5
"The bra makes pumping so much easier and if using a double pump a must have. Great product.",5
"I love this for ease during pumping. The few times I was without make you appreciate it more!",5
"This product gave me so much freedom (and still does)! I don't know how I ever lived without it!",5
"This hands-free pumping bra saved my life! Okay, a little dramatic, but it made my pumping experience so much better. I exclusively pumped and this gave me the chance to multi-task while hooked up to my pump 5 times a day. It was comfortable and held the shields securely in place. I would definitely recommend getting yourself a few if you're still nursing when you go back to work, or are exclusively pumping.",5
"This is the best hands free bra! It's tight and sturdy but also a large size so that it can fit ladies of of shapes and sizes. It is easy to put on too.",5
"I LOVE this product!!! This is one product that I use nearly everyday. Whether I pump at home or at work, it makes pumping so much easier. I knew from the 1st time I used it that it was worth every penny I paid for it. I wish I would have had it years ago when I started breastfeeding. Its easy to use, comfortable, very soft material, pretty color. Very pleased!!!",5
"Easy to use- a must have for moms going back to work and pumping. Very well made",5
"I just got this the last weekend and I love it. I got it in the light pink. It is easy to adjust to size and is comfy. Easy to put on and use. It helps get a great suction on my breasts and makes doing thing in the house so easy! Recommended for anyone that pumps!",5
"While using this, I'm able to get things done while pumping for my baby. It's comfortable and easy to use!",5
"I've tried 4 different pumping bras and this is the only one I like and keep going back to. It's adjustable which is great. And it's pretty discreet which is great when I have to pump in the car.",5
"As an exclusive pumping mom for both of my daughters this is a A life saver!!! I wouldn't have pumped for over a year with my first without and currently my 7 month old we are still going strong. I recommend this to everyone it had made life so much easier at home and work!! I'm pumping while writing this review!",5
"With having a two year old running around and a new baby this bra was a life saver. It's easy to put on and be able to pump without the hassle of holding the suction cups of the breast pump.",5
"Keeps the pumps in place, can move around room just no fast movemts. Does not lose its shape after washing either.",5
"I pumped for over a year after a surrogate pregnancy and donated to a milk bank for preemies. Let me just say - I could not have made it without this hands free bra! If you are going to pump AT ALL, I HIGHLY recommend this bra!! I cannot say enough good things about it.",5
"Very comfortable and practical item. Recommended",5
"I use this everyday to pump at work; fits great, comfy, and makes pumping so relaxing.",5
"This product is amazing. I have been using it almost everyday and it has been a lifesaver. I have a newborn, a one year old and a five year old so I need something that allows me to use my hands doing other things. I love how you can adjust the size of the bra to fit your exact size.",5
"I have twins and a 3 year old. before i got this i was constantly spilling milk because i was trying to do things to help my toddler while holding the pump with my forearms and it would drop and spill and was a disaster lol. this is a bit pricey but totally worth it. as a mom, having your hands free is completely priceless! i cannot imagine life without this anymore lol",5
"I tried several hands-free pumping bras and this one is my favorite! It adjusted to fit you, super easy to use, easily cleaned and comfortable!!!",5
"This is a great product and true to size. I pump at work and instead of needing to hold the pumps I am able to put on this bra and let the bra do all the holding while I relax or even have a chance to eat a snack. This has made pumping very easy.",5
"Love that you can use this product while checking email and working. Th bra allows you to pump and do other things at the same time. The best part of the bra is it stays up without the straps and is adjustable...as your weight shifts after giving birth, you can tighten the bra as needed (with velcro). Allows one bra to work the entire post pregnancy nursing. BEST PRODUCT & a time saver. I use it at work when I'm in a lactation room and continue working on my computer without having to hold any of the parts. I recommended to a couple co-workers and they are all very happy with how this bra has helped them be more efficient and spend less time at work making up for lost time while pumping.",5
"Ok so pumping is time consuming and can be boring. And as much as a mom pumps, it can take a lot of time away from you. I love this bra because it goes perfectly with my Lansinoh Signature Pro Double Electric Breast Pump! Its cute and I like the light pink color so it's feminine. It is actually pretty comfy too. I love the full frontal zipper which I think is totally awesome and makes it easy to use and put on and take off. It comes with straps that attach easily so you can wear it like a regular bra, as a racer back or cross strapped or halter or just as is as a strapless bra. I love this though because it makes pumping so much easier now that I dont have to hold the pump with my hands. It's easy to set up and you just insert the pump through the flaps, and they hold up really well and it works great. I have had no problems. It is like the epitome of fashionable and functional! Since using this, I can still do some of the things I need to like fold laundry, peel potatoes in front of the tv, give attention to my baby, etc! The fabric is really soft and comfy. It's kind of a stretchy material too. And it definitely makes it easier to pump since you don't have to hold them up yourself. I just wish I had one of these for when I was pumping for my other 2 children. I did receive this product for free as part of a product trial program but the experience and opinions are my own.",5
"The Simple Wishes hands free bra is a life saver. I am an exclusive pumper and have been pumping for almost 17 months. The first two month without the bra was so hard that I wanted to quit. When I got the hands free bra I was able to do things while I pumped like hold and feed my baby. It also reduced the movement of the flanges while I pump which eliminates the milk dripping out caused by my hand slipping and soaking my clothes.",5
"Absolutely love this product. It makes double pumping a breeze and so relaxing.",5
"I love this product! I am a mom of a 3 year old and an eight month old and I am an exclusive pumper and this product helps me be able to pump and to make sure that my toddler isn't getting into anything while I am busy. I hook up to the pump and am still able to walk around and do stuff. I wish I would of had this when I was pumping with my first, it would of helped our so much! One of the best things I have ever bought!",5
"After exclusively breastfeeding for 12 weeks, I had to go back to work. I ordered this hands free bra the first day back on the job, as it was so frustrating to not be able to move while pumping. I was worried about the fit, as I am a very plus sized woman. The bustier fits well, although don't think you are going to wear it all day. It is definitely a \",5
"After breastfeeding my daughter for 5 months I decided to break down and get a pumping bra. I hesitated because I only pump at night, it was just another thing to lug around and put on. What a mistake!! I don't know how but I pump so much more and efficiently than ever before. Plus my hands are free. Ladies, do yourself a favor and get this bra!",5
"I love this product. I use it daily!! The adjustable straps are amazing and easy to use.",5
"I have not returned to work yet, but this does help me tremendously! I would also like to think that using the bustier also helps get the most of my milk versus my holding it with my hands! Plus my arms don't get tired!",5
"I wish I would have purchased this sooner, but I had waited a week to figure out that it was needed! I am an exclusive pumper so this was worth the money. This bra allows you to truly be \",5
"Thick material, stays up well, completely adjustable with heavy-duty velcro. Comes with optional straps (I assume they are to be used if you wear this as your real bra). Wish it were cheaper but it seems average for pumping bras.",5
"I have a preemie so I'm pumping after every feeding and this bra has made it SO much better! Before I didn't have enough hands to even feel comfortable turning the dials on my pump, now I'm writing this review as I do it. Definitely worth the money!",5
"I bought this bustier yesterday after finding myself needing to pump both breasts in order to heal some sore nipples. It made what was going to be a very exhausting few days a little less exhausting. The bra is adjustable and I was able to find the perfect fit. It holds the flanges in place quite snugly, and allows me to use my hands to do other things to pass the time. I use it with my Medela pump, and it works beautifully. I highly recommend making the investment if you find yourself needing to pump for an extended amount of time.",5
"Easy to put on and can really pump hands free. Glad I purchased it. Can pump and do other things (like go on the computer and write a review!) at the same time. Runs on the small side though. I wear a Med/Large and I adjusted it to the widest possible fit.",5
"This has been super helpful. It makes life so much easier when you don't have to hold the bottles while you pump. I can use my time more wisely now while I pump.",5
"I haven't tried any other hands free systems, so cannot compare, but this has been most helpful as I pump. I'm a 32H bra size, thanks to my daughter, and this fits well and provides the support needed while pumping. It comes with an included halter strap, which I don't even need.",5
"This hands free bra made pumping much more comfortable for me. Holding the flanges against my chest was getting really old! I'm not getting up doing anything crazy while I pump, but it's nice to be able to drink some water, use the computer mouse or remote, or pat my baby while pumping. The bra is very snug around me right now but the zipper is quite sturdy and so is the velcro in the back. I have been using this item about twice/day for 2 weeks at home and everything is holding up so far. I take it on and off each time, so it adds a few minutes to the pumping procedure. If you have a small chest and pump frequently, you could probably wear it around as your bra under a thick structured and/or patterned shirt, but there are no cups - it is a flat compression style - so \",5
"I bought a different pumping bra, and it was ok, but this one is SO much better. More comfortable, adjustable, and feels like it's better quality. All you working breastfeeding mamas - get this one!",5
"This bra is made very well. It hold the flanges onto the breast great and allows for true hands free double pumping. I wear a size 44DDD (maybe a bit larger cup now because of the milk) and this bra works great. It doesn't offer underwire type support, but it holds the girls up enough to get the job done well.\nI recommend this bra to anyone pumping. Set up time for pumping takes a bit longer at first, especially if you have large breasts, but you get used to it quickly. The material is soft, the bra offers adjustability for size and comes with straps to help hold you up.\nIf there was any way to improve the bra, it would be that I'd love to be able to wear it while breastfeeding and be able to pump the other breast at the same time.",5
"This worked perfectly for me. It's fully adjustable in the back so you can get if fit exactly like you need it. Holds the flanges up snugly to my body so I can pump hands free.",5
"This bra is the best... Don't waste your time and money buying the other brand.... The quality, effectiveness, and flexibility this bra provides makes it the easy choice",5
"Great fit! Would really fit a wide range of sizes. Having the hands free is really nice.",5
"I love this bra, I hated pumping before I bought it but now its so much easier since I can multi-task.\nLove that it comes with straps and you can choose which side to wear it on. Also love the velcro back, adjustable to your personal size. And its really soft material which is great for when you're engorged.",5
"I tried another bra and this was one is FAR superior. My other bra eventually stretched out and there was no way to tighten it. This bra has a zipper in the front and velcro in the back in case you need to tighten it over time. I also LOVE the shoulder straps...just gives you the added support in case you produce a lot of milk ;) I HIGHLY recommend this breast pump bra. You won't be disappointed.",5
"Perfect for the multi-tasking pumper.",5
"My only regret is waiting until 6 months of pumping and nursing to buy this bra! So much more comfortable and easy to use.",5
"After trying ( and returning) the medela pump bra, I ordered the Lansinoh based on its great reviews. It's adjustable, the fabric is high quality, I use it several times a day. It's a bit expensive but worth it if you want your hands free while you pump.",5
"This makes my commitment of being a working mother that nurses so much easier. No complaints. Works perfectly!",5
"This product does wonders , so happy I ordered it!",5
"I have used this bustier every day since I got it! It's supportive and you really can go hands free. Great for the mommy of two!",5
"Great product, I'm a 40DD",5
"This bra is made really well. I love how you can really work it to fit your size. I am a pre-pregnancy 34C, and an EE while breastfeeding. They have made this bra very easy to adjust and I love that. You do want it to fit pretty tight so that it holds the shields and bottles in place. I have had zero problems with this bra, and find that it is a lot easier than holding both bottles in place, even if I'm not multitasking! Would definitely recommend for any nursing mom.",5
"By far the best one. It fits best, is adjustable, and holds the pumps in place perfectly!",5
"Easy to use and comfortable.  Has made pumping so much easier.  In my opinion, a must have if planning to pump on a regular basis.",5
"I came across this bra with my second baby and I can honestly say this is the best purchase I've made!!  It has allowed me to keep up with pumping every three hours, while caring for both my 3 month old and 2 year old. It's so easy to strap on and I can go about my daily life (within reach of an outlet).  I pump while eating with my family, changing diapers, using the computer, and just playing with my kids. I even pump driving down the road with my nursing cover on. I HIGHLY recommend this item!!!",5
"Second time mom and wished I had ordered this previously with my first child. I exclusively pump and it makes it so much easier. Definitely a must!! Love the adjustable bands and the options to add straps if desired.",5
"Have used this a few times and its great to be able to have full use of my hands while pumping. I like to compress and massage to get the most milk out and I can do that with this bra. A little pricey but they all seem to be about the same amount",5
"I love this product!  I pump at least 4 times a day for 20 minutes.  I was getting tired of sitting in an uncomfortable position holding the pump parts.  This bra works really well-it is comfortable and it holds the pump pieces in place.  Now I can  work on the computer or read a book!  LOVE IT!",5
"I read the reviews before purchasing and they were correct! I recommend everyone that is pumping gets one. One reviewer said that if you are between sizes to go with the smaller one. That was my situation however it was a close fit. I have to use the extender in the front and I have it on the last of the velcro on the back. I did not try the next size up however so I don't know if that would have been too big or not. Overall great product!",5
"[...] I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality! Soft fabric, well made and very adjustable. This will make pumping so much easier for people!",5
"Love it! I bought 2 pumping bras to compare. Right out the box, I decided to keep this one and return the medela one. This one has shoulder straps, strong adjustable velcro and an extender piece. Lots of options to create the perfect fit! Soft pink material is very comfy. Definitely worth the cost for comfort and hands-free freedom!",5
"I did a lot of shopping around for the best price and highest rated bra for pumping. This had great reviews but I was worried about the one size fits all. This bra has been perfect. Very comfy and easy to use. The zipper is high quality unlike others. Allows for good suction for pumping.",5
"Fits great\nEasy to adjust",5
"Works great! Ordered the L/XL/XXL. There are many ways to adjust it for the right fit. Gets the job done hands free. Very convenient. Great invention!",5
"I just used this for the 1st time at work and it makes pumping at work so much more comfortable. I was actually able to enjoy my pump break with reading a few pages in a great book. I haven't had time to read a book for fun in FOREVER. This product is true to size (as I am on the cusp of small and large, but ordered the small like the chart said) and very comfortable. I am going to recommend this to EVERYONE i know who is pumping!!!",5
"I am a first time mother, so I was new to pumping. I took a gamble and purchased this product after someone told me their sister uses it. I am thrilled! I no longer feel a slave to pumping. I am actually pumping both breasts while writing this review. Make your life easier and get the bustier!",5
"While this bra may not be the most attractive in appearance, it more than makes up for it in function. The openings in the cups provide great support for your breast pump flanges. The adjustable velcro back ensures great comfort and fit, even as your body changes back to it's pre-pregnancy state. Best of all, your hands are free to tackle other tasks while pumping! A true asset to all multi-tasking women!",5
"I bought this first to feel like my belly was more supported. I am already having some \",5
"I'm only 5 ft tall and it's hard to find pants that fit well.  This band has allowed me to stay in my \",5
"I started to grow out of my pants at about 3 months, I'm at 8 months now and this maternity band is still going strong. Maternity pants can be expensive, this was a great alternative.",5
"Love it! Able to fit in my pre-mat clothes still at 22 weeks, with a little waistband help from the bellaband!",5
"My wife bought this and has found it very useful. Good Product and Value.",5
"This is perfect for filling in some extra space between your pants and your shirt. It also helps with keeping pants that are too big up or just smoothing out that section a little bit.",5
"Love this shirt! Love the fit and its really comfortable. Super cute with a solid color scarf.",5
"Love this nursing bra! Fits great and holds up the girls.",5
"These were thick (but not hot) great quality leggings with a super comfy belly panel. I'm usually a S; I bought a S and have plenty of room to grow. Definitely no need to size up - maybe even a tad large. Also, I'm a long-legged 5'5\",5
"I'm about 20 weeks pregnant and I got these leggings. They are super comfortable. I think there will be plenty of room for me to \",5
"These leggings are the best! They are not sheer at all and still very breathable. They are VERY soft. I find a lot of the panels on maternity pants to be itchy...these are not itchy at all. I could live in these leggings! :)",5
"I love these pants, they are so comfortable. I wish they had different colors, I want to wear them everyday.",5
"Just got these and I love them. They are thicker than tights but not quite as thick as a solid cotton pant. There are no weird, pany-hose like seams on the thighs, so if your shirt isn't full tunic length, you will still be okay! The belly panel is comfy, and the length is perfect - I am 5'6 and they gather just a SMIDGE at my ankles, which I like because it makes them look little more like slim fit trousers than just leggings. If you are short though, you may not like this. The only possible problem I see is that because they do have that tights-like stretch to them, they may not hold up in the knees for very long. This may not be a problem for most, but I have an active 2 year old who I play with a lot on the floor, crawling around and whatnot, so these may not stand the test of toddler time :) But, we'll see.",5
"Bought these at 26 weeks and have been wearing for the past 1.5 months. They are the MOST comfortable article of clothing I own at the moment. Have held up well, and I plan to wear them through the rest of the pregnancy. I am 5'7\",5
"I just had my 3rd child and desperately needed new nursing bras. After searching for nearly a month I came across this sleep bra online. I wasn't sure if the fit would work or not but I still ordered one in black and one in the dark red. Once I recieved them I tried it on and absolutely love the fit. There's not much support but I wasn't looking for that - I wanted a good sleep bra or bra to wear around the house. The lacy, almost see through material makes me feel a little sexier too compared to other sleep bras I've had or seen. Overall I highly recommend this bra - great fit, looks great & feels great.\nFor reference I'm a 38D.",5
"I bought these 3 days ago and never want to take them off. I'm 7 months pregnant, pre-pregnancy size 8 pants, and the S/M size fits me perfectly. They don't squeeze too tight or fall down. I plan on wearing them all winter to stay warm and I'm sure they'll come in handy post-partum as my body heals and I want some belly coverage.",5
"I am really happy with these leggings. I was nervous because the biggest size offered was a M/L, when in pre-pregnancy I am a size 16 pant, but they fit amazing! They are super comfortable and soft, I feel like I could wear them all the time. They do fall down a little at the top, but since, as a pregnant woman, I use the restroom every few hours, I just adjust them then. This has been my best maternity clothes purchase so far! I'm 20 weeks, so I hope these fit till the end, cause they are great!",5
"Soft stretchy material. They do not cut into the top of my stomach like most leggings if I decide to wear full panel and don't hurt my lower abdomen if I wear them under my bump either. Every pregnant girl should get a pair (or two) of these. I plan to wear these post pregnancy as well. This time around, I'll be prepared with comfy clothes to wear in the hospital and around the house after delivery and these definitely make the cut. Enjoy!",5
"Funny story-- I saw this on my friend at her baby shower and I had been looking for some opague comfy leggings for under dresses and what not (hate tights). Did I mention I am not even pregnant? These are awesome-- thick and warm and I just folded over the top of the pant like a yoga pant. I have since bought three more! Definitely recommend this to anyone!",5
"Tried these on at the store and fell in love. Soft fabric and opaque enough to wear a shorter top. Love that they are not constricting even when you bend or sit for awhile. Pre-pregnancy I was a 6 so I went with the smallest size. Many reviews stated that they would fall down, but I haven't had that problem. I'll definitely use these after my pregnancy.",5
"I'm about a size 18 or 15 pre pregnancy. I got the Large and they are perfect! I do not have a problem with them falling down. I haven't noticed them being see through either. I'm currently 6 months pregnant. They are pretty long. I'm 5'7 and they go all the way to my ankle .",5
"so happy I purchased these leggings - they are the most comfortable pregnancy accessory I have so far!  They are great to wear with skirts/dresses or with a tshirt when hanging out around the house - super comfortable!  I'm 5'5\",5
"I've had a terrible time finding maternity pants or leggings that fit me well (aren't too saggy, always sliding down, too tight around the belly, etc). I'm 5'8\",5
"Absolutely love these! I'd definitely recommend for pregnancy as well as post-pregnancy! Very comfy and great for recovery from c-section!",5
"Love these! Extra band at top for belly support and they are thick enough to not be see thru! I am 22 weeks now, 5'5 and weighing 173...ordered a medium and they fit perfectly.",5
"Pre pregnancy I was a size 10, 170 lbs, 57, i tried on small medium and medium large and although the sm fit well, i felt that they were see through, the ml also fit and werent as stretched out so were more opaque and less see through, i bought the ml and LOVE the softness and versatility of these leggings. Ill admit they do slip a little but not enough that i have to wear my belly band with it. The leggings do feel like they dont goall the way up my crotch area but after readjusting in the bathroom they are fine, since were there every half hour. Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons to these leggings, i ended up buying a second pair, i gave it four stars because they do slip a bit. I wish they came in different colors.",5
"I am one of the people who love these! I find that they are not too tight on my belly and don't press my bladder along with everything else. I do see how some can say they do not stay up all the way, but it does not bother me, it's not like they are falling off at all. As far as other people saying they are see through I do not agree. Perhaps they need a bigger size because it's stretched to the fullest. I find these comfortable, and not too tight. I don't like when I'm being squeezed too hard by pants! I have worn these a few times-and can see myself wearing them all throughout my pregnancy. I wish I had these with my last pregnancy! Good luck to all those searching for some decent leggings... I would highly recommend these or at least give them a try! I am a size 6 and 4mos. small fits perfectly.",5
"These leggings are amazing.......so soft and comfy...AND they actually look adorable on too =) I'm 5 months along with my 5th and always avoided buying maternity leggings before, but I couldn't resist these, they are just that comfy! I'm pretty petite (5'2\",5
"Love them!! They aren't see through like many other leggings I've bought, and they are super comfy!",5
"I'm 5\",5
"Maternity is hard to shop for online, so I did need to exchange the size, in store, but other then that they are the best quality leggings I have ever seen or owned. You can tell they will last a while, and they are very smooth and comfortable. I do not plan on putting in the dryer and recommend not, since I can tell it'll shrink and you want a perfect tight fit to begin with.",5
"I bought a pair a few weeks ago and I'm buying another pair today. I'm 34 weeks and packing my hospital bag - these are a must have for that. I can't part with my other pair until delivery so I must have two. Overall, great leggings - very comfy!!",5
"I opened the package and first thought that they were too small and not worth the money. Then I tried them on and literally heaved a deep sigh. They are amazingly comfortable, soft, and stretchy. Most leggings either don't stretch enough, or stretch too much and are see through. I think they are only see through on people that bought a too small size. I imagine I wear these everyday towards to end of pregnancy, to/from home from the hospital etc.",5
"I have both this belly band and the blanket from Belly Armor. I love them both, as the really do prevent radiation (I tried the cell phone test several times). I use the blanket all the time at home, and the band when I'm out, especially when traveling. I've also started buying them as gifts for my mommy-to-be friends.",5
"Very comfortable and if you have big bust it's still very roomy. I went from a DD to a F/G and the 3x is perfect. I'm going to get another one I work out in it and it's very supportive and if comfy enough to sleep it",5
"I have been searching for a sports bra forever and finally found one I enjoy. It is a nice fit but a bit snug. I think I just need to wear it a bit more beforehand. I wear a size 42DDD so I bought size 3x which is great. Just a little snug but haven't worn it much yet.",5
"LOVE these tank tops. They are the perfect undershirt for my growing belly. They are long enough they will cover a very large belly. They are stretchy and comfortable. I will be ordering these in every color. I wear one every day, so comfy! I highly recommend these. I think they will be perfect for after pregnancy too.",5
"These are perfect maternity tanks. I wear them under everything. They are super stretchy, the are long enough to cover a long bump, and they are super comfortable. I will buy them in every color. They are my new go-to under shirt. I think they will even be great after pregnancy. Can't recommend them enough!!",5
"I am so glad i discovered these tanks with my first pregnancy. not only did i wear them through third trimester, i wore them for nursing, and even after since i have a long torso a good long tank is hard to find. You wont be disappointed!",5
"Love the fact that this is LONG. Being a tall person and carrying low long shirts are better! Only thing I would probably like to see them change is the straps being adjustable...But thats ok I'm very please with this product",5
"Best maternity tank on the market!",5
"Love this shirt! Love the fit and its really comfortable. Super cute with a solid color scarf.",5
"The bra is a must for pumpers! It's made just right as long as you get the right size. I ordered the large first, which was way, way too big. As long as your bra size is smaller than 40 w/ any cup size, no matter how much expansion you have had due to milk, it will work well! The large is just too large for anyone w/ a size 36 or 38 no matter how large the breast itself. That's all folks.",5
"This is in my top 3 favorite baby-related items I bought.  SO nice to have hands free when pumping.  It makes the time go so much faster to be able to type, text, or multi-task.  Also nice when connecting and disconnecting from the pump to make less of a mess.\n\n\n\nI like this bra in particular because-\n\n1. It can be adjusted as your size changes.  I've been pumping for 8 months and have adjusted it multiple times as I've lost baby weight and it continues to fit well.  I was concerned that there are only two sizes, but between the zipper panel and the velcro in the back, it can cover a huge range of sizes.\n\n2.  Washes well.  I've washed multiple times and I accidentally dried it once with no issues.\n\n3.  Price was very good- comparable to other bras.\n\nAll in all, a VERY worthwhile purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone who is going to pump.",5
"This bustier is great! If you're pumping and don't want to sit there and hold the bottles for 20 mins, you need this. Does not cause leakage. Worked better than expected!",5
"I LOVE this bustier. I wish someone had told me about them sooner. I use it when I am getting ready in the morning. In the 10-15 mins it takes for me to brush my teeth, put on my make up and do my hair, I am able to pump at the same time. I actually do not dread having to pump and think it will work out well when I return to work. A much cheaper solution than the Medela hand's free pump. ;)I would recommend it to anyone who needs to pump",5
"Let's face it, pumping is a huge pain, no matter how motivated and determined you are to make it work. This bra makes a huge difference in comfort level and allowing you to relax a bit - use your computer, read a book, have a snack - whatever you choose to do while you're pumping. Fabric is soft and stretchy, nice quality. Yes, I believe others when they say it's easy to cut one out of a sports bra, but this is well worth the money in my opinion!",5
"I'm using the Medela pump and i love this bra, it is very convince for me. It gives me a lot of flexibility to check my emails or text. The velcro is super good! its very tight, which is good",5
"This bra works great--I am using it right now. I am so happy to not have to sit here and hold the shields while pumping.The fabric is soft and stretchy but snug and it comes with some other accessories I haven't used yet, but I am happy with it the way it is. Woo hoo!",5
"I bought this yesterday since i was only pumping 1 oz per breast. I was getting frustrated and tired. I hated holding the bottles in my hands. I bought the XS-L at the store but was worried about the fit since i am 40D. The adjustable velcro in the back makes it fit amazingly. Its snug enough to hold up the bottles, yet not squeezing me to death. This morning, i pumped 7oz in one sitting. Highly recommend!",5
"Love this bra. Changed my whole experience pumping milk. Has made pumping milk much, much more comfortable. You can work online and get things done with this bra. Its very well made, well designed, and easy to use. I can't say enough about it. You may be reluctant to spend almost $40 on yet another baby related purchase, but I assure you...this is a must have if your a pumping mother. No regrets!",5
"The Lansinoh arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I opened it and it is sooo much better! It has many options for size.  It has extensions and it  works so great I couldn't have designed one any better than this thing. I'm very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints at all. Lansinoh did a great job with this product.",5
"Whoever invented this deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.",5
"I wasn't sure I'd end up using this...like maybe it would be hassle. It is worth every penny, as it is quick and easy to put on and you can save time by doing all kinds of things with your hands while you're pumping...writing, typing, eating, using the TV remote... :)",5
"Absolutly love the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier!!! It is easy to use, comfortable and allows you to do other things while pumping. A must have for breastfeeding moms!!",5
"Buying this product is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Although I am blessed to have a workplace that is very supportive with me having to pump a few times a day, I was always very frustrated that I could not get much work done during those times because I was having to hold up the breast shields. This bra holds the shields securely in place and allows me to keep working while I pump. I couldn't ask for anything more! Such a great purchase!",5
"I am in love with this hands free pump bustier. I wish I had it for my first baby. Pumping before was always awkward. I would always hunch over the horns and I could never get anything done. What I love about this bustier is that you can adjust the size both with the velcro on the back and the zipper panel in the front. I am also able to assist the pumping with massage since I could make it as tight or as loose as I wanted it. The only downside I am able to see is the awkwardness of getting out of it, but that doesn't even compare to the awkwardness of not having it! This is fantastic and this is a total MUST for any pumping mom!",5
"This is the perfect bra for a working, typing, reading mother!!! This is the only bra I have ever bought and my child is a little over 6 months. I started using it when he was about 2 months. I take it to work everyday and use it twice a day 5 days a week. It stays in my Medella backpack. It holds the shields in place for true hands-free pumping. In fact, I am pumping as I am typing this review. I wash it in the washer and hang it up to dry. I only wear it when I am pumping though so I am not sure of its longevity if you wear it as a regular bra on some days. Thankfully, my job has a place I can pump in peace behind a closed door. I do like the fact that it has an adjustable back. I definitely have used it since I have lost about 15 pounds since giving birth (mostly due to exclusively breastfeeding). The only slight issue is that the zipper started to give a bit. I thought it was stripped at one point. But, it is still working. I am considering buying another one in a few more months. But, for the wear and tear and price, this one is holding up well, all things considered.",5
"I wear DDD pre-pregnancy and G while nursing. An XL / Large Plus fits great with room to spare. Material is soft and zipper is easy to use. Great high quality product. Use several times a day and love it!",5
"Just tried this product after reading reviews and I love it! I have the medela pump and this slips right into it. It is really comfortable fabric and it has a velcro piece in the back that is adjustable. It's really nice to not have to hold the pump.",5
"I've been using this bustier for two weeks now, and although I had to adjust to taking the time to put it on and get the pump's flanges perfectly in place before starting, I'm very happy with it now. It's totally worth the initial set-up time because I can wash bottles while I pump, read a book, etc. The bra is highly adjustable and will go much bigger or smaller, which is great because it ensures a very good fit. It's well made and stays put, and it holds up the bottles even when they're full, though I prefer to lean forward and rest them on the counter. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and am so glad I bought it despite our tight budget- this truly was an investment that is paying off!",5
"I bought this bra so I could pump while I typed on the computer.  Works great, I don't get the annoying marks on my arms trying to hold the cups up like I used to.  The bra keeps the cups up so I don't have to hold them at all.",5
"Love this one...easier to put on, better coverage, and better fit. Should have bought this one first!",5
"This fits wonderfully and stays in place. I was skeptical of a bra that was designed to fit women size xs-L but it does! I am xs and it uses strong Velcro to switch sizes. It helps to free up my arms so that I can care for my twins while pumping. Great quality too.",5
"I have only used the bustier a couple times so far, but it was easy to put on and use. Its much easier to pump now that my hands are free.",5
"I'm pumping exclusively to feed my daughter, and this has been a huge help! Its comfortable and allows me to be hands-free while pumping, which adds up to quite a lot of time during the day. I'd highly recommend this!",5
"I just returned to work 1 month ago, and our little guy is now 3 months old. I used to hate pumping with our first son, because I felt like I was wasting so much time at work. Now I welcome pumping as a time to catch up on paperwork or reading. I'm a pediatrician, and I recommend this to friends and patients. Of all of the fancy gear we've accumulated for our little ones, this is my favorite. Absolutely worth the price.",5
"I am currently wearing size 40F bras. I had my doubts about this bra since there were only two sizes to choose from, but it is perfect. There is a large strip of hook and loop fabric for the back and a strip of fabric to zip in front, making it easily possible to customize this bra. I can email and text and even put on makeup while pumping with this bra. I highly recommend this bra for any woman of any size!",5
"Nursing my fist child, I didn't have this, so pumping was such a chore & took a lot of time away from things.  At work, I ended up skipping a session here & there, of which I underestimated the consequences.  I was struggling by 5 months to keep nursing.  With my second child, I learned about this bustier at a pump class and it has made a HUGE difference.  I can pump much more often than I would have without it.  I travel with it, and actually have been able to pump (with a nursing shawl to cover me) at an airport terminal, on an airport shutltle van & actually on the airplane with someone next to me.  I am able to pump hands free and look at pictures of my baby, eat lunch, drive (although not recommended I'm sure), etc.  I've made so much use of my driving time because of this bustier.  I'd say that over 50% of my pumping sessions happen in the car.  It's totally adjustable, can wear over sweaters or just nursing bra.  The adjustability comes in handy when you lose your baby weight or go through seasons.  I can honestly say I have maintained my milk supply because of this bustier.  My 2nd child is 8.5 months old today and no sign of my milk supply diminishing!  I recommend this to everyone I know.  Get one! I couldn't stand pumping the first time around because I felt trapped.  This time around, it's tolerable; just a slight nuisance.  ;)",5
"This is such a great addition to the occasional or every-day pumping mama. I own the Medela Freestyle pump and the clips do not fit with any other bra, especially the bras I purchased. I am very large chested with a small band size and had to put the Medela bra on, strap on all the clips and hold very still, every time I wanted \",5
"LOVE THIS! It's very comfortable and works with Medela just fine. I also have the Medela Pumping Bra and this one is much more comfortable and has stayed up instead of sliding down. I really like how you can adjust the size of it as well! What a great feature!",5
"I am almost exclusively pumping for my newborn daughter, so I'm spending a lot of time pumping. After making lots of messes and getting frustrated trying to do other things while double pumping, I decided to spend the cash and try this out due to the good reviews. I love it! I was worried it might be too small since I am right on the line between a XS/S/M size and a L/XL size, but I am glad I got the smaller size. The extra panel that zips into the front makes it just the right size for my large chest and it holds the pumps firmly to my breasts without leaking. I'm very happy I spent the money - totally worth it.",5
"Love this product! I pump for my LO, and at times I will be pumping while eating, feeding my LO, and maybe on the phone, all at the same time! It used to take me between 30-60 mins to pump, because of this pumping bra, it takes me 15-30 mins tops! The bra is adjustable to your ribcage size, and is not a thick material, so I can still do what I need to do when I have a case of mastitis. Definitely recommend this product!",5
"This bra makes it so comfortable and easy to pump. Before I had this bra I didn't seem to get a lot of milk when I pumped but now that I can search on my phone or play with baby while pumping I seem to get a lot more where my mind is on something else and I am relaxed. Buy this bra if you want to make your life a little easier.",5
"Makes pumping so much easy ,this is a must have I love how I can feed my son or be on the phone while I pump !",5
"Hands free pumping? YES PLEASE!! Do more while you pump! With the hands free bra, I am able to wash all of the bottles and storage supplies while I pump! Become more efficient by maximizing your time!!!",5
"The first few weeks with a newborn are overwhelming, and it seems we can barely find time to do anything other than pump and breastfeed. With this bra I was able to do something so basic-EAT! It seems silly, but when you have a newborn multi-tasking is your best friend. I loved my bra and even got one for my sister in law. The bra is so well adjusted and ensures a secure fit so you don't lose and of that liquid god.",5
"I am a mother of 3 and am always multi-tasking. With this bra I am able to have both hands free to fold laundry and even eat dinner! It is extremely comfortable and fully adjustable! I recommend this hands-free pumping bra for nursing/pumping moms, no matter what size your bust!",5
"I used this when my son was a newborn. Super easy to use and a nice tool. Fits perfectly!",5
"I own two of these simple wishes hands free pumping bras! I love them and make pumping so much easier and convenient;. The bra is very comfortable too and can be adjusted to fit your body. I tried multiple brands before finding this one and am so glad I did. It has made pumping a breeze and makes my nighttime routine so much easier. I highly recommend this pumping bra to anyone! The bra is flexible, the material is so soft, it fits your breasts nicely the way the fabric fits the curves of the body, the bra is adjustable to your body time (all the other brands I tried did not), and it makes my life much easier when I'm pumping.",5
"its very easy to use!",5
"The bra makes pumping so much easier and if using a double pump a must have. Great product.",5
"I love this for ease during pumping. The few times I was without make you appreciate it more!",5
"This product gave me so much freedom (and still does)! I don't know how I ever lived without it!",5
"This hands-free pumping bra saved my life! Okay, a little dramatic, but it made my pumping experience so much better. I exclusively pumped and this gave me the chance to multi-task while hooked up to my pump 5 times a day. It was comfortable and held the shields securely in place. I would definitely recommend getting yourself a few if you're still nursing when you go back to work, or are exclusively pumping.",5
"This is the best hands free bra! It's tight and sturdy but also a large size so that it can fit ladies of of shapes and sizes. It is easy to put on too.",5
"I LOVE this product!!! This is one product that I use nearly everyday. Whether I pump at home or at work, it makes pumping so much easier. I knew from the 1st time I used it that it was worth every penny I paid for it. I wish I would have had it years ago when I started breastfeeding. Its easy to use, comfortable, very soft material, pretty color. Very pleased!!!",5
"Easy to use- a must have for moms going back to work and pumping. Very well made",5
"I just got this the last weekend and I love it. I got it in the light pink. It is easy to adjust to size and is comfy. Easy to put on and use. It helps get a great suction on my breasts and makes doing thing in the house so easy! Recommended for anyone that pumps!",5
"While using this, I'm able to get things done while pumping for my baby. It's comfortable and easy to use!",5
"I've tried 4 different pumping bras and this is the only one I like and keep going back to. It's adjustable which is great. And it's pretty discreet which is great when I have to pump in the car.",5
"As an exclusive pumping mom for both of my daughters this is a A life saver!!! I wouldn't have pumped for over a year with my first without and currently my 7 month old we are still going strong. I recommend this to everyone it had made life so much easier at home and work!! I'm pumping while writing this review!",5
"With having a two year old running around and a new baby this bra was a life saver. It's easy to put on and be able to pump without the hassle of holding the suction cups of the breast pump.",5
"Keeps the pumps in place, can move around room just no fast movemts. Does not lose its shape after washing either.",5
"I pumped for over a year after a surrogate pregnancy and donated to a milk bank for preemies. Let me just say - I could not have made it without this hands free bra! If you are going to pump AT ALL, I HIGHLY recommend this bra!! I cannot say enough good things about it.",5
"Very comfortable and practical item. Recommended",5
"I use this everyday to pump at work; fits great, comfy, and makes pumping so relaxing.",5
"This product is amazing. I have been using it almost everyday and it has been a lifesaver. I have a newborn, a one year old and a five year old so I need something that allows me to use my hands doing other things. I love how you can adjust the size of the bra to fit your exact size.",5
"I have twins and a 3 year old. before i got this i was constantly spilling milk because i was trying to do things to help my toddler while holding the pump with my forearms and it would drop and spill and was a disaster lol. this is a bit pricey but totally worth it. as a mom, having your hands free is completely priceless! i cannot imagine life without this anymore lol",5
"I tried several hands-free pumping bras and this one is my favorite! It adjusted to fit you, super easy to use, easily cleaned and comfortable!!!",5
"This is a great product and true to size. I pump at work and instead of needing to hold the pumps I am able to put on this bra and let the bra do all the holding while I relax or even have a chance to eat a snack. This has made pumping very easy.",5
"Love that you can use this product while checking email and working. Th bra allows you to pump and do other things at the same time. The best part of the bra is it stays up without the straps and is adjustable...as your weight shifts after giving birth, you can tighten the bra as needed (with velcro). Allows one bra to work the entire post pregnancy nursing. BEST PRODUCT & a time saver. I use it at work when I'm in a lactation room and continue working on my computer without having to hold any of the parts. I recommended to a couple co-workers and they are all very happy with how this bra has helped them be more efficient and spend less time at work making up for lost time while pumping.",5
"Ok so pumping is time consuming and can be boring. And as much as a mom pumps, it can take a lot of time away from you. I love this bra because it goes perfectly with my Lansinoh Signature Pro Double Electric Breast Pump! Its cute and I like the light pink color so it's feminine. It is actually pretty comfy too. I love the full frontal zipper which I think is totally awesome and makes it easy to use and put on and take off. It comes with straps that attach easily so you can wear it like a regular bra, as a racer back or cross strapped or halter or just as is as a strapless bra. I love this though because it makes pumping so much easier now that I dont have to hold the pump with my hands. It's easy to set up and you just insert the pump through the flaps, and they hold up really well and it works great. I have had no problems. It is like the epitome of fashionable and functional! Since using this, I can still do some of the things I need to like fold laundry, peel potatoes in front of the tv, give attention to my baby, etc! The fabric is really soft and comfy. It's kind of a stretchy material too. And it definitely makes it easier to pump since you don't have to hold them up yourself. I just wish I had one of these for when I was pumping for my other 2 children. I did receive this product for free as part of a product trial program but the experience and opinions are my own.",5
"The Simple Wishes hands free bra is a life saver. I am an exclusive pumper and have been pumping for almost 17 months. The first two month without the bra was so hard that I wanted to quit. When I got the hands free bra I was able to do things while I pumped like hold and feed my baby. It also reduced the movement of the flanges while I pump which eliminates the milk dripping out caused by my hand slipping and soaking my clothes.",5
"Absolutely love this product. It makes double pumping a breeze and so relaxing.",5
"I love this product! I am a mom of a 3 year old and an eight month old and I am an exclusive pumper and this product helps me be able to pump and to make sure that my toddler isn't getting into anything while I am busy. I hook up to the pump and am still able to walk around and do stuff. I wish I would of had this when I was pumping with my first, it would of helped our so much! One of the best things I have ever bought!",5
"After exclusively breastfeeding for 12 weeks, I had to go back to work. I ordered this hands free bra the first day back on the job, as it was so frustrating to not be able to move while pumping. I was worried about the fit, as I am a very plus sized woman. The bustier fits well, although don't think you are going to wear it all day. It is definitely a \",5
"After breastfeeding my daughter for 5 months I decided to break down and get a pumping bra. I hesitated because I only pump at night, it was just another thing to lug around and put on. What a mistake!! I don't know how but I pump so much more and efficiently than ever before. Plus my hands are free. Ladies, do yourself a favor and get this bra!",5
"I love this product. I use it daily!! The adjustable straps are amazing and easy to use.",5
"I have not returned to work yet, but this does help me tremendously! I would also like to think that using the bustier also helps get the most of my milk versus my holding it with my hands! Plus my arms don't get tired!",5
"I wish I would have purchased this sooner, but I had waited a week to figure out that it was needed! I am an exclusive pumper so this was worth the money. This bra allows you to truly be \",5
"Thick material, stays up well, completely adjustable with heavy-duty velcro. Comes with optional straps (I assume they are to be used if you wear this as your real bra). Wish it were cheaper but it seems average for pumping bras.",5
"I have a preemie so I'm pumping after every feeding and this bra has made it SO much better! Before I didn't have enough hands to even feel comfortable turning the dials on my pump, now I'm writing this review as I do it. Definitely worth the money!",5
"I bought this bustier yesterday after finding myself needing to pump both breasts in order to heal some sore nipples. It made what was going to be a very exhausting few days a little less exhausting. The bra is adjustable and I was able to find the perfect fit. It holds the flanges in place quite snugly, and allows me to use my hands to do other things to pass the time. I use it with my Medela pump, and it works beautifully. I highly recommend making the investment if you find yourself needing to pump for an extended amount of time.",5
"Easy to put on and can really pump hands free. Glad I purchased it. Can pump and do other things (like go on the computer and write a review!) at the same time. Runs on the small side though. I wear a Med/Large and I adjusted it to the widest possible fit.",5
"This has been super helpful. It makes life so much easier when you don't have to hold the bottles while you pump. I can use my time more wisely now while I pump.",5
"I haven't tried any other hands free systems, so cannot compare, but this has been most helpful as I pump. I'm a 32H bra size, thanks to my daughter, and this fits well and provides the support needed while pumping. It comes with an included halter strap, which I don't even need.",5
"This hands free bra made pumping much more comfortable for me. Holding the flanges against my chest was getting really old! I'm not getting up doing anything crazy while I pump, but it's nice to be able to drink some water, use the computer mouse or remote, or pat my baby while pumping. The bra is very snug around me right now but the zipper is quite sturdy and so is the velcro in the back. I have been using this item about twice/day for 2 weeks at home and everything is holding up so far. I take it on and off each time, so it adds a few minutes to the pumping procedure. If you have a small chest and pump frequently, you could probably wear it around as your bra under a thick structured and/or patterned shirt, but there are no cups - it is a flat compression style - so \",5
"I bought a different pumping bra, and it was ok, but this one is SO much better. More comfortable, adjustable, and feels like it's better quality. All you working breastfeeding mamas - get this one!",5
"This bra is made very well. It hold the flanges onto the breast great and allows for true hands free double pumping. I wear a size 44DDD (maybe a bit larger cup now because of the milk) and this bra works great. It doesn't offer underwire type support, but it holds the girls up enough to get the job done well.\nI recommend this bra to anyone pumping. Set up time for pumping takes a bit longer at first, especially if you have large breasts, but you get used to it quickly. The material is soft, the bra offers adjustability for size and comes with straps to help hold you up.\nIf there was any way to improve the bra, it would be that I'd love to be able to wear it while breastfeeding and be able to pump the other breast at the same time.",5
"This worked perfectly for me. It's fully adjustable in the back so you can get if fit exactly like you need it. Holds the flanges up snugly to my body so I can pump hands free.",5
"This bra is the best... Don't waste your time and money buying the other brand.... The quality, effectiveness, and flexibility this bra provides makes it the easy choice",5
"Great fit! Would really fit a wide range of sizes. Having the hands free is really nice.",5
"I love this bra, I hated pumping before I bought it but now its so much easier since I can multi-task.\nLove that it comes with straps and you can choose which side to wear it on. Also love the velcro back, adjustable to your personal size. And its really soft material which is great for when you're engorged.",5
"I tried another bra and this was one is FAR superior. My other bra eventually stretched out and there was no way to tighten it. This bra has a zipper in the front and velcro in the back in case you need to tighten it over time. I also LOVE the shoulder straps...just gives you the added support in case you produce a lot of milk ;) I HIGHLY recommend this breast pump bra. You won't be disappointed.",5
"Perfect for the multi-tasking pumper.",5
"My only regret is waiting until 6 months of pumping and nursing to buy this bra! So much more comfortable and easy to use.",5
"After trying ( and returning) the medela pump bra, I ordered the Lansinoh based on its great reviews. It's adjustable, the fabric is high quality, I use it several times a day. It's a bit expensive but worth it if you want your hands free while you pump.",5
"This makes my commitment of being a working mother that nurses so much easier. No complaints. Works perfectly!",5
"This product does wonders , so happy I ordered it!",5
"I have used this bustier every day since I got it! It's supportive and you really can go hands free. Great for the mommy of two!",5
"Great product, I'm a 40DD",5
"This bra is made really well. I love how you can really work it to fit your size. I am a pre-pregnancy 34C, and an EE while breastfeeding. They have made this bra very easy to adjust and I love that. You do want it to fit pretty tight so that it holds the shields and bottles in place. I have had zero problems with this bra, and find that it is a lot easier than holding both bottles in place, even if I'm not multitasking! Would definitely recommend for any nursing mom.",5
"By far the best one. It fits best, is adjustable, and holds the pumps in place perfectly!",5
"Easy to use and comfortable.  Has made pumping so much easier.  In my opinion, a must have if planning to pump on a regular basis.",5
"I came across this bra with my second baby and I can honestly say this is the best purchase I've made!!  It has allowed me to keep up with pumping every three hours, while caring for both my 3 month old and 2 year old. It's so easy to strap on and I can go about my daily life (within reach of an outlet).  I pump while eating with my family, changing diapers, using the computer, and just playing with my kids. I even pump driving down the road with my nursing cover on. I HIGHLY recommend this item!!!",5
"Second time mom and wished I had ordered this previously with my first child. I exclusively pump and it makes it so much easier. Definitely a must!! Love the adjustable bands and the options to add straps if desired.",5
"Have used this a few times and its great to be able to have full use of my hands while pumping. I like to compress and massage to get the most milk out and I can do that with this bra. A little pricey but they all seem to be about the same amount",5
"I love this product!  I pump at least 4 times a day for 20 minutes.  I was getting tired of sitting in an uncomfortable position holding the pump parts.  This bra works really well-it is comfortable and it holds the pump pieces in place.  Now I can  work on the computer or read a book!  LOVE IT!",5
"I read the reviews before purchasing and they were correct! I recommend everyone that is pumping gets one. One reviewer said that if you are between sizes to go with the smaller one. That was my situation however it was a close fit. I have to use the extender in the front and I have it on the last of the velcro on the back. I did not try the next size up however so I don't know if that would have been too big or not. Overall great product!",5
"[...] I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality! Soft fabric, well made and very adjustable. This will make pumping so much easier for people!",5
"Love it! I bought 2 pumping bras to compare. Right out the box, I decided to keep this one and return the medela one. This one has shoulder straps, strong adjustable velcro and an extender piece. Lots of options to create the perfect fit! Soft pink material is very comfy. Definitely worth the cost for comfort and hands-free freedom!",5
"I did a lot of shopping around for the best price and highest rated bra for pumping. This had great reviews but I was worried about the one size fits all. This bra has been perfect. Very comfy and easy to use. The zipper is high quality unlike others. Allows for good suction for pumping.",5
"Fits great\nEasy to adjust",5
"Works great! Ordered the L/XL/XXL. There are many ways to adjust it for the right fit. Gets the job done hands free. Very convenient. Great invention!",5
"I just used this for the 1st time at work and it makes pumping at work so much more comfortable. I was actually able to enjoy my pump break with reading a few pages in a great book. I haven't had time to read a book for fun in FOREVER. This product is true to size (as I am on the cusp of small and large, but ordered the small like the chart said) and very comfortable. I am going to recommend this to EVERYONE i know who is pumping!!!",5
"I am a first time mother, so I was new to pumping. I took a gamble and purchased this product after someone told me their sister uses it. I am thrilled! I no longer feel a slave to pumping. I am actually pumping both breasts while writing this review. Make your life easier and get the bustier!",5
"While this bra may not be the most attractive in appearance, it more than makes up for it in function. The openings in the cups provide great support for your breast pump flanges. The adjustable velcro back ensures great comfort and fit, even as your body changes back to it's pre-pregnancy state. Best of all, your hands are free to tackle other tasks while pumping! A true asset to all multi-tasking women!",5
"These were thick (but not hot) great quality leggings with a super comfy belly panel. I'm usually a S; I bought a S and have plenty of room to grow. Definitely no need to size up - maybe even a tad large. Also, I'm a long-legged 5'5\",5
"I'm about 20 weeks pregnant and I got these leggings. They are super comfortable. I think there will be plenty of room for me to \",5
"These leggings are the best! They are not sheer at all and still very breathable. They are VERY soft. I find a lot of the panels on maternity pants to be itchy...these are not itchy at all. I could live in these leggings! :)",5
"I love these pants, they are so comfortable. I wish they had different colors, I want to wear them everyday.",5
"Just got these and I love them. They are thicker than tights but not quite as thick as a solid cotton pant. There are no weird, pany-hose like seams on the thighs, so if your shirt isn't full tunic length, you will still be okay! The belly panel is comfy, and the length is perfect - I am 5'6 and they gather just a SMIDGE at my ankles, which I like because it makes them look little more like slim fit trousers than just leggings. If you are short though, you may not like this. The only possible problem I see is that because they do have that tights-like stretch to them, they may not hold up in the knees for very long. This may not be a problem for most, but I have an active 2 year old who I play with a lot on the floor, crawling around and whatnot, so these may not stand the test of toddler time :) But, we'll see.",5
"Bought these at 26 weeks and have been wearing for the past 1.5 months. They are the MOST comfortable article of clothing I own at the moment. Have held up well, and I plan to wear them through the rest of the pregnancy. I am 5'7\",5
"I wear a 38C usually and the XL fits perfectly. So comfortable you can sleep in it!!",5
"I wear a 38C usually and the XL fits perfectly. So comfortable you can sleep in it!!",5
"This bra is comfortable and practical! I wear it everyday with everything, so I bought another one exactly like it. The cups have the perfect amount of padding for comfort. When you unhook the cup to nurse, there is only a strap left instead of a triangle of fabric like most other nursing bras, so it doesn't get in the way like my other nursing bras do. I have a big rib cage (I wear a size large tshirt or size 12-14 dress) and smaller B cup breasts and size XL fits me perfectly.",5
"The only thing I don't love about this bra is the price. I do think it's worth it though as a new nursing mama and someone well endowed who's been struggling through the pains of learning to nurse.",5

"The second day of wearing the belly bandit, I saw results. My husband was amazed at how fast my belly has shrunken. I'm so happy i bought this.",5
"I bought the original belly bandit before I delivered my son. I have been wearing the medium for a week and I have already lost so much of my belly! I'm going to order the small because the medium is almost too big now and it barely fit right after I gave birth. I only wear it during the day but I find it to be very comfortable. I just wear one of my pregnancy be bands from target under it and it's great! It makes my back feel so much better too when I'm wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone for post pregnancy!",5
"Have been wearing a Large for a week and have already seen a difference. Will be purchasing a smaller size to keep up the momentum. Have received comments that I don't look like I had a baby a week ago. So happy I purchased!",5
"I purchased my bandit 5 weeks pp, unfortunately I had been using a girdle with no results previously. Within 2 weeks I have already lost 4 inches from my waistline! I wish I would have had it sooner!",5
"I bought this at 4 days post-partum bc I wanted to be sure of my measurements before \",5
"I purchased my belly bandit original a week prior to my second c section. Going in on the day I had my daughter I had weighed 180 and one month after birth I weighed 148. I put the belly bandit on right after I gave birth (3 hrs or so after.) And it also helped me with breastfeeding support too. It's just all around amazing. I have recommend this to many mothers!",5
"I have bought this twice now. And each time it has done wonders for my recovery after a C-section.",5
"I waited until a couple weeks after my son was born via c-section to start wearing a belly bandit. I wish I would have worn one sooner. It really helped to shrink my uterus and to provide some much needed support after a c-section that I was not prepared for. We are trying to conceive and I will have a new belly bandit on hand before I deliver another child!",5
"I bought this with my first (after a painful first few weeks) and all I can say is I wish I would have had it from the beginning!",5
"I had a C section on 9/28 and started wearing the band on 10/1. Prior to putting it on, I couldn't climb in bed because it was too high, and getting up off the couch was difficult. Once I put it on, however, I was mobile again! It made me feel so secure and helped with the aches and pains. Plus, it's helping me shrink back down. Bonus! Love love love this product.",5
"I was pregnant with twins, and gained 40 pounds only in my belly. After birth, my abdominal muscles and back muscles were so weak, and I still looked pregnant. I wore the size medium for less than a week, then needed the small. Within days I could Velcro the small to its tightest levels and that provided the support I needed to flatten my tummy and provide back support. I enjoy wearing it and it gives an extra level of confidence. I also have the belly shield, but I prefer to wear th bandit over a fitted tank under my shirt. I'm back to a size 4 only two weeks after twins, and at my pre-pregnancy weight and feel like I look pretty good! :)",5
"It is comfortable to wear and cant see it under clothes. This is my 2nd c section and it has made a huge difference helping my tummy go down. I wish I would've bought one with my first baby! The only complaint I would have would be wishing that the length of the belly bandit was longer and covered my whole torso and not just the bottom part but overall great product and worth the money!",5
"I have only been using this for a couple weeks but can already tell a difference (compared to my last delivery where I didnt use anything after). I do wear it day and night. I was concerned it wouldnt be comfortable but it really is. I put it on the day after deliver and it helped my abdominal area feel less achy because the BB is squishing it all back in place :)",5
"I had a great experience with the belly bandit! I was given another stretchy wrap around support after my c-section and I definitely preferred the belly bandit! You can see both under clothes, but you just had a baby! Give your self some slack :) I liked the belly bandit more than the other one because it gave incredible back support! I will definitely try this again with our next pregnancy!",5
"I bought this product right before delivery because I wanted to have it at hand! This is by far the best product I've ever used for my tummy. I will let my before n after photos do the talking. I will recommend this product to all my pregnant friend for postpartum recovery success!",5
"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5
"This single-handedly got me back to my pre-baby weight in less than 6-months! Thank Gawd for the Belly Bandit",5
"I've bought several of these for friends. They absolutely love them and the results.",5

"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5
"This single-handedly got me back to my pre-baby weight in less than 6-months! Thank Gawd for the Belly Bandit",5
"I've bought several of these for friends. They absolutely love them and the results.",5
"This is the best - definitely helped with my post baby body. And also felt comfortable and supportive.",5
"I recently ordered upside belly being 33 weeks pregnant and starting to have extreme low back pain which is making everything more challenging. I am 5ft6 and 135 lbs now and was a size 2 prior to pregnacy and found that the size small fit well. Product seems to be made of good quality material but only had a day so far. Ice pack spot is awesome as that is exactly where I need it! Also purchased the full belly leggings in a size s and they are super comfy so far. Very pleased with my purchases and thought the service was easy and fast!!",5
"I have been wearing for a few weeks and can't believe how good the Upsie is! I went one day without it and couldn't believe how much I missed the added support for my growing belly. Keeps the little one off my bladder a bit as well which is really helpful. I am 5'4\",5
"I started having horrible lower back pain around month 6-7 during this pregnancy. I wasn't able to go grocery shopping without being almost crippled and walking like a penguin from hurting so bad. I purchased my band earlier this month, and fell in love! Whenever I have back pain or will be in a situation where I know I will end up with back pain, I put this baby on! It relieves the pain I already have and completely prevents the pain I would usually get.\nWay worth every penny! I tried on at least 10 other brands and this was the most comfortable and showed the least under my clothes:)",5
"The Upsie Belly is the best gifts I've ever received! I'm a petite person and by around 25 weeks, the back pains were becoming more difficult to ignore. Add to that sciatica and soon enough even walking around hurt, every step sent pain from the top of my left hip down to my knee. A friend have me the Upsie Belly and I swear I felt the relief almost immediately. It fit so well under my belly and covered the right amount of my lower back. Having the slight lift of my belly took off so much pressure. The material is soft and didn't irritate my skin the way I've heard some women complain about other brands and it didn't shift around either. I work as a medical assistant so I'm constantly on the move and sitting and getting up, so that was very important for me.",5
"This worked very well with helping to support my belly & back during my pregnancy. The ice pack was great to just to help with the aching back. I used it mostly while working 12 hour shifts but toward the end of my pregnancy I wore it most of the time.",5
"I bought this when I was 22wks pregnant with my second. It is seriously a life saver! My belly and back were so sore after being out and being on my feet for even just an hour. My upsie belly definitely relieved so much of the pressure and made this pregnancy so much better. I recommend it to every pregnant woman who experiences the same discomfort. Totally worth every penny!",5
"I was starting to get back pain due to the big heavy belly...this belt works fabulously. It eases the weight on your back and hips significantly and relieved my pain. Highly recommend it. It's also easy to wash (I wore it during the very hot summer and hand washed it regularly)",5
"I've had terrible back and hip problems with this pregnancy so bad that I had to go to the physical therapy. I put this one and it was immediate relief. I don't have to go to my therapist anymore. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone with back and hip problems!",5
"I purchased this at about 20 weeks hoping it would help relieve the pressure on my legs and veins. I am now at 36 weeks and wear this all the time and I love it!! It has really helped with my comfort and even though my veins are still bad it definitely helps take the pressure off my legs and has prevented back pain. I exercise daily and the upsie belly is great to support my tummy and keep me comfortable. I feel so much better when I wear this and even though it is a bit pricey it has been worth the investment and has held up extremely well.",5
"My mom bought me this after weeks of hearing me complain about back pain while pregnant with my daughter and I love it! It is the most helpful product I've had my entire pregnancy!!",5
"I started having back pain at about 26 weeks and the Upsie Belly has helped a ton! I think it will be very helpful after my c-section, too.",5

"Great tank - fit is good and style is great! Nice and long and has a good stretch to it! Use it for running, walking and in general is comfortable to wear all day. I purchased it in the green and also black (black seems to run smaller & is shorter). Fit is good and I am sure it will be great throughout my whole pregnancy - currently 6 months and fits nice - with room to grow!",5
"I love this tank, very comfortable (even for longer 5 mile runs)! The quality is outstanding. Worth every penny!",5
"I just had my 3rd child and desperately needed new nursing bras. After searching for nearly a month I came across this sleep bra online. I wasn't sure if the fit would work or not but I still ordered one in black and one in the dark red. Once I recieved them I tried it on and absolutely love the fit. There's not much support but I wasn't looking for that - I wanted a good sleep bra or bra to wear around the house. The lacy, almost see through material makes me feel a little sexier too compared to other sleep bras I've had or seen. Overall I highly recommend this bra - great fit, looks great & feels great.\nFor reference I'm a 38D.",5
"I bought these pants in store and I love them. I am 5'1\",5
"I love these pants. They are super soft and plenty thick, unlike many other leggings I've tried. The small fit great. I'm normally a 4-6 pre-pregnancy and about 5'7\",5
"I really like how the material is heavier than most spandex leggings. It doesn't show every single bump & lump and will provide a little more warmth. The material is 76% polyester, 20% rayon, and 4% spandex. I'm 22 weeks, 129lbs, 5'5\",5
"I am 24 weeks pregnant and was about to offer up my firstborn child for some maternity leggings that are not see-through. I have tried high-end brands at $50+ a pop, middle-of-the-road, and cheapies. I've tried at least 15-20 pairs of leggings or capri leggings in the past two months and absolutely everything is see-through! I was at my wit's end - why can't someone make maternity leggings that are opaque!? I thought for sure, for the price, these would be sheer at least in the rear, but they are absolutely perfect! The fabric is sturdy but not too thick, there is ample room in the belly (they're actually a bit too big on me now, but I am sure I will \",5
"I'm 7 weeks and my jeans are getting tight already. I found these today and thought I'd give them a shot. THEY. ARE. AMAZING. I'm a sz 22, and the XXL fits like a dream.",5
"A friend let me borrow these when I was pregnant, and they were by far my favorite leggings, but seemed to be always out of stock. I kept watching my local store and online for them to be restocked, and ordered 2 pairs once they became available.\nGreat length for my long legs, thick enough to wear in public as actual pants, and super comfortable. I was 140 lbs / 5'8\",5
"I really like these- Just bought them today! No complaints, just really happy with this pair!",5
"These leggings are amazing! They are so comfortable, dark, and feel expensive. I am definitely keeping them post-baby. They are thick enough to where you can't see panty-lines or anything like that, but I would still recommend wearing a tunic or top that covers your buttocks if you are a curvy girl like me. They fit me a bit long but I am 5'1 so that is to be expected. It doesn't matter though since they are leggings, they should fit any height pretty well.",5
"I love these leggings, mainly because of the thickness. You absolutely cannot see any underwear- they are not seethrough at all. It's nice not to have to stress about my shirt completely covering the back of my butt. They are nice and thick and soft. Great quality.",5
"I'm not pregnant. I buy maternity clothes because I have a large waist and small hips. I can wear a smaller size in maternity pants than regular pants. These are incredibly comfortable for anyone. I wear an over- blouse or t-shirt with them.",5
"Super soft and comfortable. Highly recommend for 1st and 2nd trimester. (I am only 22 weeks into my first pregnancy so I cannot yet speak to the 3rd trimester!)",5
"Good, thick, quality material! Very comfortable during pregnancy and post pregnancy! Awesome price!",5
"Fit great, super cozy & warm, not too tight around the ankles and long without being way too long...Im 5'6\",5
"Nice and thick comfy leggings!  Keep you warm too!",5
"Best leggings ever! Keeping these well after babies! Bought online just thinking they would be normal leggings but gladly wrong. Thicker and softer and waistband feels good. Ordering me some more right now!",5
"I highly recommend these to anyone searching for leggings that are not a cheap thin material! I prefer cotton leggings anyway over that leotard type material and these fit the bill perfectly. What I like most is that they make me feel \",5
"Bought these because I love stretchy pants when pregnant. They are super comfy and do not push in at my waistline like a lot of other under the belly pants I've tried do. They are long enough for me but I am tall so that may be an issue for shorter legs. I just wish they had these in other colors because I would have them all!",5
"I got these in the mail today and It is LOVE! They are great, super comfy, and not shear! I love that they are under belly, its one less hot layer on my already hot tummy. They seem a little long but I am 5'4\",5
"These are nice, basic cotton leggings. Thick enough that you can't see through them and nice and long so they can be tucked nicely into a pair of boots. I like the low-cut elastic band since I can wear these earlier in my pregnancy and not have to fold down a full panel (which from my past pregnancy was a total pain even when full term).",5
"I am obsessed with these crop pants for working out while pregnant!! I love that the back is lower than the tummy panel in front-my back avoids getting extra sweaty. Super comfortable and breathable fabric.",5
"Great pants for running. I bought two pairs because I like them so much.",5
"I'm on my 6th pregnancy and just discovered these. They are wonderful. I wear them at least four days a week. Can't imagine going through this pregnancy without them. I wore them from 3 months pregnant and am still wearing them at 33 weeks. They're still super comfy. As far as sizing, I'm 5' 9\",5
"These are great. I'm 23 weeks and there's no chance of them slipping when I jog. I've worn them several times since they arrived a few weeks ago and I anticipate them being a staple to my summer wardrobe (running errands, lounging around). I did order one size up and the fit was great.",5

"very comfortable for night and day wear. I think it provides good support without cutting in to my shoulders",5
"I love my nursing bra. I purchased this bra with my first pregnancy and it is going strong with my second child. Easy to access clips. Moveable and flexible material that allows any woman to wear, regardless of her size. I wore this bra into delivery of my second child and it felt like I was wearing nothing. It is both supportive and non intrusive when it needs to be.",5
"I decided to buy an Ameda nursing bra after trying serval other brands from motherhood maternity stores. Best decision ever!! The fit was perfect & it is very comfortable! After 4 months, it is still just like the 1st day I bought it! These are made for comfort & made to last!! Will never buy any other brand again!",5
"Very comfy! Easy to use! Nice for sleeping & easy to wash!",5
"I picked these up in-store today.  I don't know why online they aren't just called \",5
"I live in Chicago and wanted a thick legging to wear for the winter. This is perfect, almost as thick as a pant but still the look of leggings. I got the small and am 5'4 so they are a bit long, and the belly panel is loose for me at 20wks. I use the Bumped Cami to help keep them tight and have gotten so many compliments on them. Only have washed a few times so not sure how well they will hold up. Have been turning them inside out so hopefully they wont pill like other reviewers have mentioned.",5
"Every pregnant woman should have a pair of these. In fact, they should come in five different colors. They are so comfortable that once you wear them, you'll realize there is NO point to wearing uncomfortable khaki pants as a pregnant lady.",5
"These are great pants, especially for the price. They are a nice thick legging, so they're warm for winter and not see through at all. I ordered a small and they're a little big for me (for reference, I'm 27 weeks pregnant, 5'4\",5
"These are great! I just bought them today and they are super comfy!! I usually don't wear leggings but I like these enough to wear them :)",5
"These pants are wonderful.  I'm 24 weeks and finally decided to break down and buy a pair of pants as my pre-pregnancy ones are too uncomfortable now.  It's a huge difference! I wish I would have bought them sooner! I like my pants to fit a little tight, I am 5'3'' and usually wear a 4/6 before pregnancy. I had to get an XS in these and I'm glad I did.  They tend to slip down a little throughout the day.",5
"Perhaps Liz Lange updated these pants since the last reviewers tried them, but these are by far the greatest maternity pants I've had. They're extremely comfortable and look great dressed up or dressed down. They do pill a little bit, but I think in my case it's from such constant washing and wearing, so that's to be expected. I'm usually a small-medium pre-pregnancy, and I bought these pants in a small. I would recommend sizing down (I may try an XS for a second pair) because the band tends to loosen a bit and will slide down somewhat easily. Other than that, these are the greatest maternity pants!",5
"Like wearing sweat pants to work! Very comfortable, great for the later stages of pregnancy.",5
"I can't say enough good things about these leggings! They fit great, they are super comfortable, are good quality, and they don't fall down!! Couldn't be happier--highly recommend.",5
"This is the best nursing bra ever! It has the right amount of coverage, holds things in place nicely. It was my absolute favorite, and i had purchased 6!!!",5
"Fits perfectly and feels very comfortable. I love that it is easy to open.",5
"I am a 40DDD and have tried many different nursing bras and this is the best! It is super comfortable! It holds everything in, like a sports bra, so if you are looking for more of a lift this isn't the one, but for comfort and firm support you'll love it!!",5
"most comfortable nursing bra I've tried so far. I was severely engorged during my 1st week postpartum and this bra was a God send. The material is so soft and stretchy. I'm currently a 38DD and have trouble finding comfortable supportive nursing bras, this one is true to size and surprisingly supportive.",5
"I'm normally a 38 DD and I went with the XL. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and everything I read about this bra is true. Not the most supportive but comfortable, true to size, and perfect for lounging around the house feeding a baby while recovering from a c section which is what I will be doing! I highly recommend this bra!",5
"I had a nursing bra from my last baby and it was falling apart because it was my \",5
"40DD and this bra in XL was perfect. Had to return others to get this one in another color--wish there were more color choices! Nice support, comfortable material and easy operation of access panels. This is THE bra to get, especially for large busts!",5
"This nursing bra is more comfortable than the sleep nursing bras I ordered. Not really enough support or \",5
"Didn't think I needed a nursing bra (thought I was special for some reason). Its super comfortable and highly recommend it!",5
"As heavy chested woman I was skeptical about how this bra would fit, but being 8 months pregnant you go more for comfort than looks. It fits perfectly and I am now comfortable to go about my day without the discomfort of normal bras.",5
"I love this bra. I currently have five and between nursing two children (one for 15m and one for 11m now) I have worn out five. Eventually the clasps in the back come apart on all the bras, but other than that I don't have any complaints.\nThe bra is the most comfortable I've found for nursing and pumping. I've tried multiple styles and brands. I've purchased from target, soma, and motherhood maternity and these are the best.its comfy enough to wear day and night.\nI have size large and I'm a 36 DDD. They stretch out a bit and need to be washed to tighten back up.",5
"I wore this starting at 20 weeks to make sure I was covered during that time when your regular clothes start getting too small and maternity clothes are still too big. Towards the end of my pregnancy it had just enough compression to help \",5
"I wore this pretty much the entire time i was pregnant and I think it saved me!\nA great support and made all of my clothes fit so much better.",5
"I own 7 of these Tanks in Black I love them. I weigh 245lbs and I am not pregnant but I love the fit of these.Perfect!",5
"When using a hip bandit place the belly shield low enough to cover your incision.\nWorks well to keep excess skin in place when putting on a belly bandit.\nExcellent for reminding you to keep better posture without causing discomfort.",5
"I'm happy I bought this to wear under my Belly bandit! Definitely made it more comfortable.",5
"I bought this after finding out I had to have a c-section with my twin girls. I gained 70 pounds and already lost 50 in the two weeks my girls have been born. Not to mention I have been able to up and moving the same day I had my c-section! I recommend this product to anyone who wants help recovering and wants to lose their baby weight as quick as possible.",5
"Most of the bad reviews are calling this a belly bandit with poor compression. This goes under the bandit so you can use lotions without getting your bandit dirty. The belly shield does just that although I did find that it slightly yellowed the inside of my belly bandit. Great product to help keep your belly bandit on your belly where it should be.",5
"I bought this to go along with my bandit and I really liked it. It did contain the mess of oils and lotions that I used on my belly. I plan on still using the product with other clothes while moisturizing my stomach and hips. A little pricey, but I am happy I got it.",5
"Extremely Soft!!!! Fits loosely on a 38C/D frame. Over all great buy, now just waiting for cooler weather to wear it.",5
"runs a little small, but it's cute!",5
"Finally a designer came up with boho sheek designs that are Xs to plus size! And affordable! I purchased this top and love the way it feels on and fits! This is a piece that can be worn year round and is gonna be a staple in my closet!",5
"Definitely going to pick up another color or 2. I got the green and it is a really pretty shade.",5
"Just wish it came in more colors.",5
"I really enjoy this tank top. I have a very long torso so it makes it difficult for me to find shirts that are long enough. This fits me perfectly. It's a high quality tank top.",5
"I love these shirts. Great fit and super comfy",5
"Perfect fit will buy again",5
"This tank is great. Comfy, soft, functional, and most importantly long! It covers the tummy and is flattering. Need it in every color. I got this tank on sale for 7.00, great price point for this tank.",5
"Fits perfect! One of my favorite summer shirts.",5
"I've tried on and I'm happy with the Vintage look and size of T-shirt. Haven't worn yet, but I believe I will be happy. It's a bit more see thru than average t-shirts but I'm okay with that, some people might not be? But I think it gives a plan white t-shirt a bit of sexiness, that's just my opinion. The thinness of it actually gives the shirt an almost marbled effect and it dresses it a bit. I don't think it will effect quality at all but I haven't washed or worn out yet. I think material will hold up well though.",5
"Love this dress, covers well and is very ladylike. The tie belt has two gold accents that set it off beautifully.",5
"Love the bright colors, the scuba fabric is flattering. Fit is perfect!",5
"The dread of finding something to wear to the Christmas party is over. This dress is classic and sexy. I'm not dreading the party this year- hoping to find another time to wear this dress. It is the perfect little black dress- with some sparkle! Looking forward to shining this year instead of just covering up all in black. Pairing with black tights and shrug to complete the look!",5
"This dress is such a nice quality! It looks much more expensive than it is. I wore this the other day and received so many comments.",5
"The look, the fabric, the drape, the fit are all fantastic on this dress.",5
"This dress was just the right touch of easy and cool elegance for a casual holiday party. But I don't think it's limited to \",5
"Lightweight, doesn't wrinkle, fits perfectly, and is even slimming. My new favorite summer dress.",5
"Beautiful dress very ligth,elegant true to it's size.Had alot of compliments on it we brought 5 dresses (all my sisters) wore for our mother's 90th birthday celebration. The dress was a blast and so was her party.",5
"Cute dress, very comfortable, a good bit of stretch to the fabric, slight taper at waistline so it's not boxy. Sleeves are chiffon (thankfully- was worried based on the picture they might be a cotton material). I usually wear size 14 or 16 and an XL fits well with a little room to spare.",5
"Fits great, washes well, and great quality for the price. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. I wish this silhouette was available in other patterns/colors. I would buy them all!",5
"I own two pair of denizen slim fit straight Jeans and lovve them so I order three pair online received them and washed before wearing OMG nothing like the fit I have with my others 36x34 is correct but nothing slim about these they bag to the size of my non slim jeans \",5
"Unlike the other person who reviewed... I can't stand cropped jackets!! It's very difficult to find a denim jacket that actually passes you hips. This was a win for me. The fit and color were perfect too.",5
"Very comfy and I get a lot of compliments on them! I got them for a trip to Yousemite and they were very comfy easy to break into. I recommend these for all genders!!",5
"Great addition to your fall shoe collection.",5
"Was absolutely ecstatic when I saw this on Target.com! Purchased them right away in my usual size - US 10. I was a bit worried because patent is tight at times, but this fit perfectly. Loose enough for my front toes to breathe, but tight enough so as the back doesn't fall off while I walk. Really easy to walk in because of the platform sole + the rubberized track sole. Love love love! Just saw that a new color was released - considering if I should get that color as well! Super perfect for the cooler months to come. By the way, the brand is Mossimo for those who are wondering.",5
"They are supper comfortable and easy to walk in! They are so cute as well, perfect for the office. I got them in a size 10 and they fit like a glove, I also got the brown as well and those fit the same.",5
"I bought these because they reminded me of the Steve Madden shoes of the late 90s. I ordered them in size 6, and they fit perfectly. Very cute and comfortable. They have the look of a much more expensive shoe. Great for work!",5
"I bought this in my local store in my usual size XS so feel it runs TTS. The arms and back are a little bit stiff but I think will loosen up with wear. The denim has no stretch and is a nice weight; hence the stiffness. It dips in at the waist and is not at all boxy.The inside stitching could be better (loose threads after washing and drying) but it is not unraveling. Overall, a good buy. And most important, there is NO funky odor at all!",5
"I looked at other denim jackets in the past but this jacket is the best by far. I recently bought it and I love it. I'm a little person for a 21yr old, so I got assuming it would be a bit big even though I got a XS. It's that kind of big that is super comfy. I have my own light jacket I can wear under it and it makes it perfect for when it gets cold. I am in love with this jacket.",5
"I got this to wear around my upper waist for flowy tops and dresses. It's really cute and looks expensive. It adds instant style to anything.",5
"Love this top! I get complements every time I wear it - was online to buy another as back up and noticed my size out of stock :( maybe next year ....\n\nI bought a Medium and I'm 5'8\",5
"Fits well, looks cute, right on trend!",5
"Great jumpsuit! Perfect for fall.\nRuns big for me (ordered a meduim, pants size is a 6/8) and the medium was too big. So I had to reorder a small.\nBe advised it has no stretch, but other than that it's perfect! Looks better in person than in the photos.",5
"Looks way cuter in person! I hook it to the furthest link so that it fits right where my neck and chest meet, but not quite like a choker. It's very tiny and elegantly simple which is exactly what I was looking for. (I also bought a very similar one at the same time from the store-- the silver elephant. It's the same length and style. I used this same review for that one, too, bc I love them both! lol.)",5
"I have been trying to find a jean that fit my curves and this EXCEEDS my expectation!! This jean moves with you without making you feel constricted like some other jeans do. LOVE the feel, LOVE the look, LOVE the stretch. MUST BUY!!",5
"These jeans were the perfect fit except for the length. I have a hard time finding pants that fit at 5'4\",5
"It's like they custom tailored these just for me! I'm a 5ft9 mommy of two, got junk in the trunk and a kangaroo pouch. Finding jeans that fit me comfortably and dont look like total mom jeans has always been a challenge. These broke my jean slump for sure! I will be back for more!",5
"Great feel to the fabric. Love the sleeve length. It's perfect for layering. If wearing alone I'd go up one size for looseness! Will buy more when available!",5
"Fits well, washes nicely, perfect weight, perfect length for leggings",5
"Great colors, altho if you order blue cheetah you will get olive, and vice versa, terrific and noticeable improvement in warmth when used as layering piece, very pleased, not bulky.",5
"For the past couple years I've purchased these shirts. Every year they have a selection of colors and patterns. I purchased the blue leopard print one. This is a comfortable shirt to wear with jeans.",5
"Love them have bought in every color",5
"This fabric is so soft! Though it's black and it is summer time, I do not feel hot when wearing it. The material is a bit sheer so if you aren't wearing a black or nude bra, you will need a cami underneath of it.",5
"I love this T-shirt you can feel the quality of material for the price it's a steal your right on Target.",5
"It's extra extra long, but I like how I can gather it up around my waist for a softer look.",5
"These are the perfect tanks; just the right length and comfortable.",5
"Very nice cami's! They fit great and are super comfortable. I wil probably buy more! Thanks!",5
"Very nice cami's! They fit great and are super comfortable. I wil probably buy more! Thanks!",5
"I use them for layering in the winter. Wish they make a turtleneck",5
"I had tried this top on in the store so I knew I wanted a larger size for a looser fit. If you order your normal size it will be a pretty tight fit. The detail is a nice subtle touch to the solid color.",5

"This is my fourth or fifth Merona top - I have the tees, tanks, sweaters, etc. I love the blend of Rayon cotton a tiny bit of spandex. Thanks again - these are such a value at full price that when they are marked down, it's almost a gift!",5
"I love Mossimo and this is one of my fav shirts",5
"I love these shirts so much I had to pick up a couple more colors. These have a great fit, not to loose or too snug. Perfect weight to wear alone or layer under a sweater. I prefer the v-necks, and these are the perfect v.",5
"I bought a couple of these in heather gray because they were on sale for a good price. When I got it, I immediately ordered another one in black. I love this tank so much. It is long, which I love. I like my shirts long so it balances out tops that might feel short to me. I love that it is light-weight. When it's really hot outside I hate having to layer tops because I overheat. This feels better than layering with a standard cotton tank. It's also very soft and kind of silky so it doesn't grab onto the shirt that you layer over it. This is going to be my standard tank for layering from now on.",5
"I have several of the Ultimate T shirts. I bought this one for the color. Upon receipt, I noted that the color is not as bright as the photo. However, I am keeping the shirts because the true color is still OK. I buy the XXL size because I do not care for a tight fitting shirt. I really like the Ultimate T shirts because they do not shrink or pill.",5
"Fits perfect, washes well, great for winter layering.",5
"The ribbed material is very comfortable and non-constricting. HOWEVER! It is very sheer, I wear a black tank top underneath and it's quite noticeable. I think this would be really cute with a skin-tone tank underneath.",5

"Can be worn alone, thick enough, or under something, thin enough.  Have held up well after many washes. Nicer than J.Crew",5

"So flattering!\nLove the color!",5
"This tank top is adorable, flattering, and on trend. I'm 5'6'', 155 pounds, and the medium fit very well - flowy but fitted. It will look great under a chambray top, or on its own with black shorts. So excited, I want to buy two!",5
"It's a kind of burnout fabric, so it is a bit see through, but with a nude bra, all is fine. I love how it looks with black or white capris underneath. It is very cool for summer. I have it in the dark gray as well. I am 5'5' and an athletic 136 lbs and M works for me perfectly.",5

The V is quite deep so you'll want to be careful how you wear it.\n\nIt's a lovely taupe color and the birds that are colored happen just enough to be accenting without being too bold.\n\nThe fit is just like in the picture.",5
"True to size and I love the way it looks on! I'm plus size and ordered it in 2x and it fits perfectly not too tight but not too loose either. The length is perfect as well its not too short it lands right in the middle of my thighs.\nJust for reference I'm 5'5 and weigh 216 and carry most of my weight in the stomach/ abdomen area.",5
"I am in love with this tee, it is super casual and slouchey but in a very cool way. I Really love the longer length and the fact that the V neck isn't so low that I have to wear an undershirt although the shirt is on the thinner side. Another note, it initially seemed like the fabric was not very soft but wears very comfortably. Liked it so much that I have already ordered two more colors!",5

"I've tried many 3/4 boatneck tees and this is one of my favorites! I have this in two colors and they are both in heavy rotation! I wish they had more (looking at you, navy and white striped) in stock. Great deal and great fit. I usually wear XS in Merona and that's what fit best here too. 5'5\",5
"I have this in several different colors. The length goes just past my hips, and while snug, it's not at all too tight, or unflattering. I find them easy to dress up and down. Love, love, love these tops!!",5
"The boyfriend v-necks from target never disappoint me. I have these in several colors. Great price for value, esp. when they're on sale! The cut of this style seems to vary throughout the year. The shirts seem longer and thinner in the spring and summer, and shorter but thicker in the fall. The longer thinner styles are my favorite, since i live in Texas. Pretty true to color and size, and mine have hold up pretty well. Great shirts!!",5

I wear a 10 Petite from Ann Taylor or LOFT, and this size 10 fit me perfectly.\nI returned to the store to buy more after wearing them for just a few\nmoments.

I like it because it looks like denim, but is softer and doesn't wrinkle. For reference, I ordered a M. I'm 5'7'' and 140 lbs. Fit is great, maybe a bit long, but it looks cute with a tuck or half tuck.",5
"I didn't try on this shirt before I purchased it and luckily it fit very well.",5

"I found this online, but probably wouldn't have looked twice at it in the store once I saw it in person. It fits well and is very cute on. I bought a size small, but normally wear an extra small in a button up in this brand. The extra small was too tight across the back. Great purchase to wear with boots and leggings.",5

"I bought these at the store for 50% off and I like them so much I came online to see if I could order more. They really look like jeans unless you examine them closely, and they are truly as comfortable as sweats. WAY better than Pajama Jeans. There is no drawstring, just a wide elastic wasterband. I notice that the men's style has pockets; that would be a nice feature. I sure wish they had these online.",5

I could have gotten a size smaller but I wanted to share it with my twin sister. It is very comfortable and not too tight in the arms (which I love) and it has strong seams. The blue is a dark navy blue and matches with almost anything. Very pleased. I ordered this online to pick up in stores and it was fast and easy to complete.",5
"I bought this jacket for an interview and it fit perfectly! I'm usually a 2 in jackets and that's just what I got. It's soft and comfortable. You can dress it up for work and a night out or pair it with a plaid shirt and jeans for a casual look. I'm so glad I bought this blazer!",5

I work at a library and this looks so cute and professional and I've gotten many compliments on it. I always have trouble finding skirts that are long enough to hit at my knee for a professional work look and this skirt fits the bill. Since I am tall, though, I'm guessing it would probably be too long for anyone with shorter legs.",5

I either bought mine a while back or I didn't read the description, because I didn't expect pockets (I never would on a pencil skirt) so that didn't bother me! I actually had to get rid of mine recently because it no longer fit, but I am definitely ordering again in my new size!",5

"I'm usually a size 2 but they were a little snug so I bought the size 4 and they were very comfortable. They do stretch out a little after wearing them_like blue jeans. So, I have to wash after each wearing or just put in dryer so they shrink a little. But, the comfort is worth it!",5
"fit just right. has a small 'cap' sleeve. Best part is that the armholes are not super large/wide. Don't have to wear a cami under this, but you could. This blouse is a print, sorta navy and a very light pink, very light! Goes nicely with jeans or black pants.",5
"I wear these to work but they are also comfortable enough to wear anytime, anywhere.",5

"I own this shirt in three other colors. It's a flattering length and slightly roomy, enough to be comfortable to work in all day but not too flowy.

It's a bit more see thru than average t-shirts but I'm okay with that, some people might not be? But I think it gives a plan white t-shirt a bit of sexiness, that's just my opinion. The thinness of it actually gives the shirt an almost marbled effect and it dresses it a bit. I don't think it will effect quality at all but I haven't washed or worn out yet. I think material will hold up well though.",5

Personally, I prefer to wear them with a tunic top for modest coverage. So far they have washed well and dry quickly. How well they hold up to repeated washings remains to be seen. The price was right, delivery quick, and fit true to size.",5

These pants were the first to be delivered.\n\nFirst of all, these pants have a really cute pattern that doesn't get stretched out, or become see-through when I wear them (I am not a skinny girl).

It has a nice, easy fit and lays well. It's something that stands out on its own with minimal accessories or no accessories and looks very stylish. I tried it with on with a low wedge sandal and a pair of high wedges; the dress looked great with both. The colors are exactly as in the photo and are very nice as is the print and lightweight fabric.",5

"Very pretty dress little big in top, order took longer to come in than planned so I returned the dress because I needed it for a wedding and had got something else or I would of kept it.",5

"I just bought this less than an hour ago. Vintage style, great fit as if it was tailored just for me. Bought it in a large since my bust size, yet still very fitted around my waist. Fabric is soft against skin and the price was a steal.",5
"I love this dress! I almost didn't try it on in the store because it looked so drab on the hanger. However I put it on and is actually a very flattering dress. It provides a classic shape. And just like the other review I tend to be a bit bigger in the bust so the stretchy fabric gives enough to where I didn't have to go up a size to fit my chest and then be too big in the hips. I have worn it twice and have received a lot of compliments on it. Definitely can't be shy wearing it either. The bold pattern is unique and passes as a vintage chic dress.",5
"This dress was very flattering, had a great fit (I bought a large - usually wear a dress size 10) and received so many compliments throughout the day on it. Great for work!",5
"I just wore this dress to church for the first time today. I paired it with some ruby earrings and red pumps. It was on fire! Beautiful cut and great spandex material. I wish it came in more colors.",5

"Love this dress! I received many compliments on it. Luckily, it fit me perfectly. I did need to shorten it though because I'm 5'3\",5
"I bought this for Easter and it was perfect! Love the fit and love the material. I have nothing bad to day!",5
"Cute dress, very comfortable, a good bit of stretch to the fabric, slight taper at waistline so it's not boxy. Sleeves are chiffon (thankfully- was worried based on the picture they might be a cotton material). I usually wear size 14 or 16 and an XL fits well with a little room to spare.",5

"I loved this dress on picture as well as when I tried it on. It is true to size, has some stretch-ability, and feels comfortable on. The pattern is very unique. I am happy with my purchase.",5
"The look, the fabric, the drape, the fit are all fantastic on this dress.",5
"I love the style of this dress. I bought it in Large and I am a size 10. It fits perfectly. The waist is a tiny bit higher than a usual shirtwaist waistline, so since I have a higher waist, it works well. Can't wait to wear it.",5
"This dress is such a nice quality! It looks much more expensive than it is. I wore this the other day and received so many comments.",5
"I was fairly hesitant to try these on, but I'm glad that I did! I ended up buying these instead of the jeans I normally buy. They fit snugly yet move with you so they stay comfy. The super cute patter on the pockets only sweeten the deal! I feel like I can wear these just about anywhere and they go with most of my tops! I will be buying more.",5
"I am normally a size 7 with most of my skinny jeans, but with these you might want to size up, they are a little snug fit. They are so cute and i love the ripped style and the plaid. Totally get them, very stylish.",5
"loved everything! it was so easy to just look for what i wanted.",5
"Oh thank you, so much, Target, for these jeans. They are perfect. The fit is beyond compare. Yes, they are comfy too. The legs are just the right size for me, they do come in roll cuff, if you need to lengthen. They are so very stylish when worn. The distress is just the right amount. I love these jeans. Enjoy, while they last.",5

"Just exactly what I expected.",5
"Freezing NY winters - Warm enough??",5
"I looked at this for the longest time. It was on sale, but of course by the time I made up my mind, it wasn't. After a week, it was again, so I ordered a medium and a large to see which would fit best.\n\nThe medium was perfect. For reference, I'm 5'6\",5
"these are a very lightweight material, yet made with structure (no elastic waist--zipper and snap like trousers or jeans). Yet they feel like pyjama pants. They are so comfortable and nicely fitting. I do need to get them hemmed, as they are very long. I love the idea of wearing these to work, but my son thinks they are pj pants, so my guess is others would too. They are a very nice, very lightweight pair of what could be considered dressy pants. Not your typical pair of pants, but if you like the way they look, I would buy them!",5
"I have been looking for high-waisted black slacks for years and finally found them! I love these pants. They are very elegant and flowy. The legs are a bit wider than I would otherwise care for but not enough to make me not like them. The size runs big. I'm 5'6\",5
"Matches a lot of my tops, is comfortable to wear.",5
"I am 5 months pregnant & wanted some good skirts for the summer. The maternity skirts are few and far between so I went with a women's just bought larger size. I love it so much that I purchased a size smaller for after baby. Very soft & comfortable! I would say it runs a little big otherwise wonderful!",5

"Amazing prints and comfy!!!",5
"My last great pj's came from Target over 20 years ago. I still have them, I still love them. They are showing some signs of wear. With winter nights, coming on, I wanted another nice pair of cozy pj's. I wanted the button front. The top is fine. But, I am petite so the pants are a little long. No matter I can tailor them or roll up the waist. I am going to sleep in them, or lounge.",5
"Absolutely love this for cozy nights at home",5
"Love this so much! great for lounging",5
"Feels lightweight yet warm at the same time. Size was exact and it was delivered when it was supposed to be",5
"I usually wear a medium so I ordered that, it fits a little big and baggy but I think that is how it's suppose to fit. It's extremely soft and warm. I didn't dry it when I washed it so it fit the same.",5
"Very cute and comfty",5
"I'm grateful to the reviewer who said this ran small! I usually wear a medium in juniors and a small in women's and I got the extra large and it fits perfectly! For reference, I'm 6 feet tall fitness instructor, have big shoulders , small waist and wear size 6. i got the red--very pretty burgundy /navy mix, and the sleeves are long enough for me!",5
"The material is of good quality, very rugged and sturdy. The colors are rich and vibrant. Keep in mind these are Junior sizes so you'll need to order a size or two larger.",5
"I do agree the sweater is thin, but the material is not cheap. This is exactly what I have been looking for. Pattern is beautiful and it is very comfortable.",5
"Love this long sweater. It's thin enough that it doesn't look bulky. It is slimming. It also looks great with a pair of skinny leather pants and boots... Love this! Please add more colors - Tan and black would be nice.",5
"I love this. It's a good weight-- not too heavy-- so it hangs really well.",5
"Love this! Pretty true to size although if you are heavy chested I would go up one size for the draping. This duster can be dressed up or down. sophisticated Aztec print that helps you look put together even while dressed casual.",5
"Love it. True to size L, got the black/ grey. It's not very thick, More for a light fall season but it's nice with boots & leggings. Love the hood and drape style, covers that back all the way down to right above the knee.",5
"It's such an adorable swimsuit! I'm so glad I bought 2 so that I could try on the sizes since this isn't sold in stores. I'm normally a size 4-6, 5'2\",5
"I bought this cover up to go over my swimsuit on my Vegas vacation but I love it so much that I have started wearing it out and about. I am not normally a fine of leopard print but I love this for some reason. $30 might be a little high but it is exactly what I was looking for.",5
"I absolutely love this swimsuit! It is incredibly flattering and has just a hint of sexy on the back side. I ordered a large and it fits my 5'8\",5
"So cute and flattering! I have a long torso and wide hips, so one piece suits usually don't work for me, but this one did! For reference, I usually wear a 6 in pants/skirts and a 4 in tops (34C bra) and I got a large. Great to find a one piece that not only fits my body but is neither too revealing nor an old lady/swim team suit.",5
"After three kids, I'm not so comfortable in a two piece and I can't quite come to terms with a tankini (makes me feel like a \",5
"I wanted a sexy one-piece and this is perfect. I am a mom and feel frumpy in most one piece suits, but I don't always love wearing two pieces. This is a nice alternative as it shows some skin but not too much.",5
"I am usually an XS in juniors and got a Small and it fits perfect - I would suggest ordering a size up. Good padding, creates some pushup without underwire. Would recommend!",5
"I'm a 34B. Ordered a large and fits perfect!!! Order at least one size up from normal size.",5
"I'm a 34 B and I ordered a Large due to the other reviews claiming it ran small. Fits perfect! Definitely for small-boobed women.",5
"I love this shirt. It looks great with either jeans or leggings. I'm 5'10 and 180 so I like to cover my stomach area up. I'm wearing an XL. You absolutely need to wear shell under it because it is almost see-through. It is very soft but a bit thinner than I imagined, but since we aren't exactly having a cold winter I don't mind....this will be a 3 season shirt for me. A long sweater goes with it nicely anyway. I wish Target carried this in more colors.",5
"Bought this for my mom and we both loved it. You definitely need to wear a camisole or tank underneath as it is very see through. But that isn't from lack of quality, it's just the style of it. It comes with either a necklace or belt with it - I didn't get a chance to fully check out that part before I hurriedly wrapped it! I was focused on making sure the top was nice and figured whatever came with was just a bonus! My mom loves it and is planning on wearing to her next party.",5

"I love this blouse. I'm 5'9 with very wide shoulders and large chest 38D. My lower 1/2 is size 10 which makes getting blouse to fit my upper 1/2 a challenge and lower 1/2 a challenge. Many times the waist area is too big. This X-large fits beautifully and because of the pleating down the front of the blouse, it really flows and doesn't look maternity at all.",5
"Great shirt! super soft! Love it!",5
"I've been using the Boppy Tummy Support Band and am amazed at the relief it has given me! The hot/cold pearls that fit in the back pocket helped relieve my back pain. The Band is able to be pulled pretty snug, so you can really feel the heat or cold of the pearls. It also helped support my tummy in front. I didn't wear it to the store one day and immediately wished I had because I could feel the difference in my stomach not being supported. \n\nI've tried a couple of other bands with my 1st pregnancy and they were so bulky and itchy. I liked that this band was smooth and couldn't be seen under my clothes and the material is very breathable. A couple minor things I would change about the band would be the tag on the inside. It could just be me because my skin is sensitive but I found it very itchy. I just wore a tank top and put the band over it to help with the tag. Also, if you don't velcro it perfectly and sit down it irritates your belly. Again, wearing the band over the tank top solved that! \n\nI wish I would have had this band with my 1st pregnancy. Overall, it has helped me with a lot of discomfort and I will continue to use it for the rest of my pregnancy. I also prefer sleeping with this band on for support rather than using a body pillow. I'll keep this product in mind for a baby gift for pregnant friends!\n\n[...]\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I am very happy with this Tummy Support Band. However, I bought the S/M first based on my pre-pregnancy size. I was typically a medium, 5'5\",5
"I have to be honest, I did think this support band would help much. I have not really had a problem with back pain during my pregnancies but this one bring my third pregnancy and being a nurse working 12 hour shifts, my back was taking a beating. I started wearing this support band to work and it helped tremendously. Without using the band, I would be in excruciating pain. If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this product expecting to use it mainly for the thera-pearl heat/cold pack (how great is it to have a product that holds the heat/cold in the perfect spot even while you're moving around?), but I've actually ended up using it to help with muscle pain/pulling when I move around. Without it I can't do any shopping because my belly feels like it's tearing after even a short amount of walking (3rd trimester). It helps SO much; I'm so glad I bought it. The only negative I can think of is that I have to make sure that my shirt or the tummy panel of my pants is underneath it or the velcro can irritate my belly.",5

If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this belly support as I had backpain and this product helped me a lot! If you need a belly band to relief some pain or to help your heavy belly i definitely recommend it! Its a good deal for this price, and the cold/hot option in the back can be useful too. I agree that it runs a bit big and it can sometimes moves but overall it's a must have in my wardrobe!",5
"I bought this two months ago and it has been a life saver. I work 12 hour shifts and couldn't have survived them without it. Great support!",5
"I wish everything wasn't velcro--but it definitely gets the best fit because of it. This seems to help me balance my belly and I like that it will grow with me! I wear it when I'm standing or walking a lot. Sitting can get uncomfortable if wearing for a long time. The cold/hot insert will be great in the summer--its waiting in my freezer!",5
"I recently ordered upside belly being 33 weeks pregnant and starting to have extreme low back pain which is making everything more challenging. I am 5ft6 and 135 lbs now and was a size 2 prior to pregnacy and found that the size small fit well. Product seems to be made of good quality material but only had a day so far. Ice pack spot is awesome as that is exactly where I need it! Also purchased the full belly leggings in a size s and they are super comfy so far. Very pleased with my purchases and thought the service was easy and fast!!",5
"I have been wearing for a few weeks and can't believe how good the Upsie is! I went one day without it and couldn't believe how much I missed the added support for my growing belly. Keeps the little one off my bladder a bit as well which is really helpful. I am 5'4\",5
"I started having horrible lower back pain around month 6-7 during this pregnancy. I wasn't able to go grocery shopping without being almost crippled and walking like a penguin from hurting so bad. I purchased my band earlier this month, and fell in love! Whenever I have back pain or will be in a situation where I know I will end up with back pain, I put this baby on! It relieves the pain I already have and completely prevents the pain I would usually get.\nWay worth every penny! I tried on at least 10 other brands and this was the most comfortable and showed the least under my clothes:)",5
"The Upsie Belly is the best gifts I've ever received! I'm a petite person and by around 25 weeks, the back pains were becoming more difficult to ignore. Add to that sciatica and soon enough even walking around hurt, every step sent pain from the top of my left hip down to my knee. A friend have me the Upsie Belly and I swear I felt the relief almost immediately. It fit so well under my belly and covered the right amount of my lower back. Having the slight lift of my belly took off so much pressure. The material is soft and didn't irritate my skin the way I've heard some women complain about other brands and it didn't shift around either. I work as a medical assistant so I'm constantly on the move and sitting and getting up, so that was very important for me.",5
"This worked very well with helping to support my belly & back during my pregnancy. The ice pack was great to just to help with the aching back. I used it mostly while working 12 hour shifts but toward the end of my pregnancy I wore it most of the time.",5
"I bought this when I was 22wks pregnant with my second. It is seriously a life saver! My belly and back were so sore after being out and being on my feet for even just an hour. My upsie belly definitely relieved so much of the pressure and made this pregnancy so much better. I recommend it to every pregnant woman who experiences the same discomfort. Totally worth every penny!",5
"I was starting to get back pain due to the big heavy belly...this belt works fabulously. It eases the weight on your back and hips significantly and relieved my pain. Highly recommend it. It's also easy to wash (I wore it during the very hot summer and hand washed it regularly)",5
"I've had terrible back and hip problems with this pregnancy so bad that I had to go to the physical therapy. I put this one and it was immediate relief. I don't have to go to my therapist anymore. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone with back and hip problems!",5
"I purchased this at about 20 weeks hoping it would help relieve the pressure on my legs and veins. I am now at 36 weeks and wear this all the time and I love it!! It has really helped with my comfort and even though my veins are still bad it definitely helps take the pressure off my legs and has prevented back pain. I exercise daily and the upsie belly is great to support my tummy and keep me comfortable. I feel so much better when I wear this and even though it is a bit pricey it has been worth the investment and has held up extremely well.",5
"My mom bought me this after weeks of hearing me complain about back pain while pregnant with my daughter and I love it! It is the most helpful product I've had my entire pregnancy!!",5
"I started having back pain at about 26 weeks and the Upsie Belly has helped a ton! I think it will be very helpful after my c-section, too.",5

"I would recommend to anyone who wants to save money on buying new maternity pants. This really helps make any pants fit. I like that you can use it for jeans and for dressy pants since 2 are with buttons and the others with hooks. I love it great money saver!",5
"I wear a uniform to work and at 10 weeks I'm already busting out of my uniform. I want to wait until I'm in my 2nd trimester to share the news at work, so I bought this in hopes of buying some time until I break the news and can wear civilian clothes. They are awesome and extremely comfortable. I've also used them in my jeans that have gotten a little snug and they work perfectly. Highly recommend!!!!",5
"I should have gotten this so much earlier in my pregnancy. Super easy to use, and let me get back into a few pants I had given up on over a month ago. Currently am 5 months along, and am just now starting to use the longer of the two belts (pre-pregnancy pants size 8). The \",5
"I ordered this for use during that awkward phase of pregnancy where you dont quite fit your old jeans but you're not quite big enough for maternity jeans.  I am barely showing so I used to shortest extender in the package and it worked very well.  While using the extender my zipper stayed up and my jeans still felt like I was wearing them the normal way. I would definitely recommend this to other prego's.",5
"This is a really great product. I am almost 5 months pregnant and it has been wonderful to be able to still wear my pre-pregnancy clothes, and with the different sizes it looks like I might be able to get through the whole pregnancy using this.",5
"This did everything it promised. I used it only for postpartum but i think the entire kit would work especially well for the early weeks of pooching during pregnancy.",5
"Love this belt, it's great for saving money and staying in your current jeans without having to buy ugly maternity pants!",5
"It is very easy to use. I love the fact it can be adjusted throughout your entire pregnancy. Works very well with my jeans and dress pants for work.",5
"I absolutley love this kit!! It works perfectly for those pre pregnancy pants that just barely wont button! I am so excited that they make this!!",5
"This kit comes with belly belts of 2 sizes. I am using the smaller one and love it. It just extends the belt and thats all I need for now. I am wearing my regular jeans and trousers and feel v comfortable. Love it!",5
"Great item to have, instead of buying those expensive, unflattering maternity jeans. Comes in different sizes as your belly grows! Must have!",5
"Is a very usefull piece, you can wear all your clothes whenyou are pregnant and do not fit into pregnancy clothes. I do recommed this product.",5
"This item is a great purchase to make in early pregnancy. If you are a small person and will possibly outgrow your clothes very quickly once your waist stars to thicken, this is a great way to keep being able to wear your pre-pregnancy clothes.",5
"My daughter got these in the mail as a surprise from me. Timing was perfect they were going out to a party and she wasn't showing much but when she went to put on the pants she wanted to wear they were not going to button. She was so happy I had just sent these and she was able to finish dressing in the outfit she planned and was really excited about having these, She loves theim!",5
"This is a great button extender. It stays on, looks good and helped me wear my pre-pregnancy clothes through month 5.",5
"This product offers a great way to fit in regular clothes in the early months of pregnancy. I hope to use it through my pregnancy and since it expands I think I will be able to. This is a great idea and I just love it!!",5
"I really got a lot of use out of the Belly Belt. I bought it when i found out i was pregnant and i was able to keep wearing my work clothes and jeans for six months of my pregnancy. After my son was born i went back to using the Belly Belt instead of wearing the maternity pants for a more comfortable fit. I love that the kit comes with two different size belts and a set with hooks for dress pants!!",5
"This product is great! I use it with all of my jeans! I tell all my friends about this product that is pregnant!",5
"I have three pairs of my favorite Express jeans and thanks to the belly belt I am still able to wear them at 7  mos prego. It is just now starting to wear and tear but I wear it almost every day. I dont use the fabric it came with because its not very useful. [...]",5
"I absolutely love the Belly Belt! It has helped me to stay in my pre-pregnancy jeans comfortably. I have no complaitns whatsoever",5
"This belly band is a life saver so far. I am in my second trimester & so far the belly band is holding up pretty well. I'm hoping the belly band works well into my last trimester so that I can wear my jeans a little longer instead of shopping for maternity pants.",5
"I am now 15 weeks pregnant with my second child and have just purchased a Belly Belt. It is seriously the best maternity purchase I have ever made.I am still wearing my pre-pregnancy jeans and plan to for the remainder of my pregnancy, with Belly Belt.I find the belts and material really handy - they pull my jeans together while giving me that extra bit of room and I have used the maternity a couple of times, I found it to sit very well.Great Buy... recommend to everyone.",5
"This is my second pregnancy and my how I wish I would have found this with the first one! I used the belly band during my first pregnancy and I saw the belly belt this time around and had to give it a try. This thing is AMAZING! I am 14 weeks and very small framed (size 0) and this is perfect for all of my pre pregnancy jeans, shorts and slacks. It is not bulky at all and you can't even tell that I am wearing it, even under tighter shirts. I would highly recommend this to any mom to be!!",5
"I am very petite and had enough trouble finding pants to fit before I got pregnant. Having the Belly Belt is a life saver!!! Hopefully the two sizes will get me through my entire pregnancy so that I won't even have to buy maternity pants! I would recommend this product to anyone that is pregnant! It will save you a ton of money in the long run!!",5
"ok!!! so- I am now 8 months pregnant and still wearing my regular clothes. I am by no means a small pregnant woman. My belly is huge and I wear a size 14 pant (pre-pregnancy) and am still wearing them thanks to the Belly Belt! Really- I have saved a ton of money because I did not have to buy new professional clothing to wear to work, I just use the belly belt in my slacks and wear longer (maternity) shirts to cover the fact that my zipper is down. I will say though- I do not like the inserts that come with the belt- they just ride up and come out- so I just leave my zipper down(no one can see it anyways) I am still giving this product 5 stars though! Great invention!",5
"I am 22 weeks now and I simply love this! If my blouse is long enough, i wear it on its own, or else I will slide on a belly band to cover up. Recommended for all pregger ladies!",5
"I have both this belly band and the blanket from Belly Armor. I love them both, as the really do prevent radiation (I tried the cell phone test several times). I use the blanket all the time at home, and the band when I'm out, especially when traveling. I've also started buying them as gifts for my mommy-to-be friends.",5
"When using a hip bandit place the belly shield low enough to cover your incision.\nWorks well to keep excess skin in place when putting on a belly bandit.\nExcellent for reminding you to keep better posture without causing discomfort.",5
"I'm happy I bought this to wear under my Belly bandit! Definitely made it more comfortable.",5
"I bought this after finding out I had to have a c-section with my twin girls. I gained 70 pounds and already lost 50 in the two weeks my girls have been born. Not to mention I have been able to up and moving the same day I had my c-section! I recommend this product to anyone who wants help recovering and wants to lose their baby weight as quick as possible.",5
"Most of the bad reviews are calling this a belly bandit with poor compression. This goes under the bandit so you can use lotions without getting your bandit dirty. The belly shield does just that although I did find that it slightly yellowed the inside of my belly bandit. Great product to help keep your belly bandit on your belly where it should be.",5
"I bought this to go along with my bandit and I really liked it. It did contain the mess of oils and lotions that I used on my belly. I plan on still using the product with other clothes while moisturizing my stomach and hips. A little pricey, but I am happy I got it.",5

"The second day of wearing the belly bandit, I saw results. My husband was amazed at how fast my belly has shrunken. I'm so happy i bought this.",5
"I bought the original belly bandit before I delivered my son. I have been wearing the medium for a week and I have already lost so much of my belly! I'm going to order the small because the medium is almost too big now and it barely fit right after I gave birth. I only wear it during the day but I find it to be very comfortable. I just wear one of my pregnancy be bands from target under it and it's great! It makes my back feel so much better too when I'm wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone for post pregnancy!",5
"Have been wearing a Large for a week and have already seen a difference. Will be purchasing a smaller size to keep up the momentum. Have received comments that I don't look like I had a baby a week ago. So happy I purchased!",5
"I purchased my bandit 5 weeks pp, unfortunately I had been using a girdle with no results previously. Within 2 weeks I have already lost 4 inches from my waistline! I wish I would have had it sooner!",5
"I bought this at 4 days post-partum bc I wanted to be sure of my measurements before \",5
"I purchased my belly bandit original a week prior to my second c section. Going in on the day I had my daughter I had weighed 180 and one month after birth I weighed 148. I put the belly bandit on right after I gave birth (3 hrs or so after.) And it also helped me with breastfeeding support too. It's just all around amazing. I have recommend this to many mothers!",5
"I have bought this twice now. And each time it has done wonders for my recovery after a C-section.",5
"I waited until a couple weeks after my son was born via c-section to start wearing a belly bandit. I wish I would have worn one sooner. It really helped to shrink my uterus and to provide some much needed support after a c-section that I was not prepared for. We are trying to conceive and I will have a new belly bandit on hand before I deliver another child!",5
"I bought this with my first (after a painful first few weeks) and all I can say is I wish I would have had it from the beginning!",5
"I had a C section on 9/28 and started wearing the band on 10/1. Prior to putting it on, I couldn't climb in bed because it was too high, and getting up off the couch was difficult. Once I put it on, however, I was mobile again! It made me feel so secure and helped with the aches and pains. Plus, it's helping me shrink back down. Bonus! Love love love this product.",5
"I was pregnant with twins, and gained 40 pounds only in my belly. After birth, my abdominal muscles and back muscles were so weak, and I still looked pregnant. I wore the size medium for less than a week, then needed the small. Within days I could Velcro the small to its tightest levels and that provided the support I needed to flatten my tummy and provide back support. I enjoy wearing it and it gives an extra level of confidence. I also have the belly shield, but I prefer to wear th bandit over a fitted tank under my shirt. I'm back to a size 4 only two weeks after twins, and at my pre-pregnancy weight and feel like I look pretty good! :)",5
"It is comfortable to wear and cant see it under clothes. This is my 2nd c section and it has made a huge difference helping my tummy go down. I wish I would've bought one with my first baby! The only complaint I would have would be wishing that the length of the belly bandit was longer and covered my whole torso and not just the bottom part but overall great product and worth the money!",5
"I have only been using this for a couple weeks but can already tell a difference (compared to my last delivery where I didnt use anything after). I do wear it day and night. I was concerned it wouldnt be comfortable but it really is. I put it on the day after deliver and it helped my abdominal area feel less achy because the BB is squishing it all back in place :)",5
"I had a great experience with the belly bandit! I was given another stretchy wrap around support after my c-section and I definitely preferred the belly bandit! You can see both under clothes, but you just had a baby! Give your self some slack :) I liked the belly bandit more than the other one because it gave incredible back support! I will definitely try this again with our next pregnancy!",5
"I bought this product right before delivery because I wanted to have it at hand! This is by far the best product I've ever used for my tummy. I will let my before n after photos do the talking. I will recommend this product to all my pregnant friend for postpartum recovery success!",5
"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5
"This single-handedly got me back to my pre-baby weight in less than 6-months! Thank Gawd for the Belly Bandit",5
"I've bought several of these for friends. They absolutely love them and the results.",5
"This is the best - definitely helped with my post baby body. And also felt comfortable and supportive.",5

"I started to grow out of my pants at about 3 months, I'm at 8 months now and this maternity band is still going strong. Maternity pants can be expensive, this was a great alternative.",5
"Love it! Able to fit in my pre-mat clothes still at 22 weeks, with a little waistband help from the bellaband!",5
"My wife bought this and has found it very useful. Good Product and Value.",5
"This is perfect for filling in some extra space between your pants and your shirt. It also helps with keeping pants that are too big up or just smoothing out that section a little bit.",5
"Great to pair with bright colored maxi skirt for spring & summer",5
"These are the softest pants I've ever put on. Incredible! Very light as well.",5
"Very flattering. Perfect length. Not too high-waisted, but high-waisted enough. Pictures don't do it justice.",5
"I was quite happy when I saw it. Look so much cuter than the picture. Definitely recommend.",5
"Pale lavender almost pink, and a dark purple almost navy. Gorgeous color. Great length. Love it",5
"I've been using the Boppy Tummy Support Band and am amazed at the relief it has given me! The hot/cold pearls that fit in the back pocket helped relieve my back pain. The Band is able to be pulled pretty snug, so you can really feel the heat or cold of the pearls. It also helped support my tummy in front. I didn't wear it to the store one day and immediately wished I had because I could feel the difference in my stomach not being supported. \n\nI've tried a couple of other bands with my 1st pregnancy and they were so bulky and itchy. I liked that this band was smooth and couldn't be seen under my clothes and the material is very breathable. A couple minor things I would change about the band would be the tag on the inside. It could just be me because my skin is sensitive but I found it very itchy. I just wore a tank top and put the band over it to help with the tag. Also, if you don't velcro it perfectly and sit down it irritates your belly. Again, wearing the band over the tank top solved that! \n\nI wish I would have had this band with my 1st pregnancy. Overall, it has helped me with a lot of discomfort and I will continue to use it for the rest of my pregnancy. I also prefer sleeping with this band on for support rather than using a body pillow. I'll keep this product in mind for a baby gift for pregnant friends!\n\n[...]\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I am very happy with this Tummy Support Band. However, I bought the S/M first based on my pre-pregnancy size. I was typically a medium, 5'5\",5
"I have to be honest, I did think this support band would help much. I have not really had a problem with back pain during my pregnancies but this one bring my third pregnancy and being a nurse working 12 hour shifts, my back was taking a beating. I started wearing this support band to work and it helped tremendously. Without using the band, I would be in excruciating pain. If I used the band, I would only have a little bit if discomfort. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",5
"I bought this product expecting to use it mainly for the thera-pearl heat/cold pack (how great is it to have a product that holds the heat/cold in the perfect spot even while you're moving around?), but I've actually ended up using it to help with muscle pain/pulling when I move around. Without it I can't do any shopping because my belly feels like it's tearing after even a short amount of walking (3rd trimester). It helps SO much; I'm so glad I bought it. The only negative I can think of is that I have to make sure that my shirt or the tummy panel of my pants is underneath it or the velcro can irritate my belly.",5

Its a good deal for this price, and the cold/hot option in the back can be useful too. I agree that it runs a bit big and it can sometimes moves but overall it's a must have in my wardrobe!",5
"I bought this two months ago and it has been a life saver. I work 12 hour shifts and couldn't have survived them without it. Great support!",5
"I wish everything wasn't velcro--but it definitely gets the best fit because of it. This seems to help me balance my belly and I like that it will grow with me! I wear it when I'm standing or walking a lot. Sitting can get uncomfortable if wearing for a long time. The cold/hot insert will be great in the summer--its waiting in my freezer!",5
"I bought these pants in store and I love them. I am 5'1\",5
"I love these pants. They are super soft and plenty thick, unlike many other leggings I've tried. The small fit great. I'm normally a 4-6 pre-pregnancy and about 5'7\",5
"I really like how the material is heavier than most spandex leggings. It doesn't show every single bump & lump and will provide a little more warmth. The material is 76% polyester, 20% rayon, and 4% spandex. I'm 22 weeks, 129lbs, 5'5\",5
"Fits very nice! I normally wear small, but bought this in XS. Love that the V-neck isn't too low!",5
"These are super comfy and opaque. They are exactly what i was looking for! I bought 2 pairs!",5
"Love, love, love this nursing bra. I've tried many brands/styles and this one is by far the best. Very supportive, comfortable and is great quality. I own a few and wear and wash them every day. They have held up wonderfully. My only suggestion is not to dry them. They will shrink slightly. But other than that, air drying keeps them in perfect condition. Very pleased.",5
"Super comfortable and slimming. The perfect combination after you have a baby!",5
"I have 5 of these tanks in various colors. I am a 36DD pre-pregnancy and even larger while nursing. An XL was a good fit for me. They are quite low cut, so I don't wear them out unless it is underneath another shirt.",5
"It's long enough and not too low cut. It's stretchy and gives you a bit of compression which is exactly what you need after having a baby.",5
"I love this cami. The fabric is really smooth, stretchy and soft. The clip down feature works really well for me and I wear this under my clothes most all of the time right now. It makes nursing so much easier. I also really like the slimming factor. It made my clothes look nicer right after I have birth because it helped to smooth everything out. The price is a little expensive but I will pay it because I do like this cami. I am a 42 DD and the XL works for me. It is fitted",5
"This is perfect for wearing around the house or out under another top.",5
"I actually think this bra is comfortable. I am a DD and despite not having underwire this bra still gives me enough support. I liked this bra enough, I bought it again.",5
"I bought these 3 days ago and never want to take them off. I'm 7 months pregnant, pre-pregnancy size 8 pants, and the S/M size fits me perfectly. They don't squeeze too tight or fall down. I plan on wearing them all winter to stay warm and I'm sure they'll come in handy post-partum as my body heals and I want some belly coverage.",5
"I am really happy with these leggings. I was nervous because the biggest size offered was a M/L, when in pre-pregnancy I am a size 16 pant, but they fit amazing! They are super comfortable and soft, I feel like I could wear them all the time. They do fall down a little at the top, but since, as a pregnant woman, I use the restroom every few hours, I just adjust them then. This has been my best maternity clothes purchase so far! I'm 20 weeks, so I hope these fit till the end, cause they are great!",5
"Soft stretchy material. They do not cut into the top of my stomach like most leggings if I decide to wear full panel and don't hurt my lower abdomen if I wear them under my bump either. Every pregnant girl should get a pair (or two) of these. I plan to wear these post pregnancy as well. This time around, I'll be prepared with comfy clothes to wear in the hospital and around the house after delivery and these definitely make the cut. Enjoy!",5
"Funny story-- I saw this on my friend at her baby shower and I had been looking for some opague comfy leggings for under dresses and what not (hate tights). Did I mention I am not even pregnant? These are awesome-- thick and warm and I just folded over the top of the pant like a yoga pant. I have since bought three more! Definitely recommend this to anyone!",5
"Tried these on at the store and fell in love. Soft fabric and opaque enough to wear a shorter top. Love that they are not constricting even when you bend or sit for awhile. Pre-pregnancy I was a 6 so I went with the smallest size. Many reviews stated that they would fall down, but I haven't had that problem. I'll definitely use these after my pregnancy.",5
"I'm about a size 18 or 15 pre pregnancy. I got the Large and they are perfect! I do not have a problem with them falling down. I haven't noticed them being see through either. I'm currently 6 months pregnant. They are pretty long. I'm 5'7 and they go all the way to my ankle .",5
"so happy I purchased these leggings - they are the most comfortable pregnancy accessory I have so far!  They are great to wear with skirts/dresses or with a tshirt when hanging out around the house - super comfortable!  I'm 5'5\",5
"I've had a terrible time finding maternity pants or leggings that fit me well (aren't too saggy, always sliding down, too tight around the belly, etc). I'm 5'8\",5
"Absolutely love these! I'd definitely recommend for pregnancy as well as post-pregnancy! Very comfy and great for recovery from c-section!",5
"Love these! Extra band at top for belly support and they are thick enough to not be see thru! I am 22 weeks now, 5'5 and weighing 173...ordered a medium and they fit perfectly.",5
"Pre pregnancy I was a size 10, 170 lbs, 57, i tried on small medium and medium large and although the sm fit well, i felt that they were see through, the ml also fit and werent as stretched out so were more opaque and less see through, i bought the ml and LOVE the softness and versatility of these leggings. Ill admit they do slip a little but not enough that i have to wear my belly band with it. The leggings do feel like they dont goall the way up my crotch area but after readjusting in the bathroom they are fine, since were there every half hour. Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons to these leggings, i ended up buying a second pair, i gave it four stars because they do slip a bit. I wish they came in different colors.",5
"I am one of the people who love these! I find that they are not too tight on my belly and don't press my bladder along with everything else. I do see how some can say they do not stay up all the way, but it does not bother me, it's not like they are falling off at all. As far as other people saying they are see through I do not agree. Perhaps they need a bigger size because it's stretched to the fullest. I find these comfortable, and not too tight. I don't like when I'm being squeezed too hard by pants! I have worn these a few times-and can see myself wearing them all throughout my pregnancy. I wish I had these with my last pregnancy! Good luck to all those searching for some decent leggings... I would highly recommend these or at least give them a try! I am a size 6 and 4mos. small fits perfectly.",5
"These leggings are amazing.......so soft and comfy...AND they actually look adorable on too =) I'm 5 months along with my 5th and always avoided buying maternity leggings before, but I couldn't resist these, they are just that comfy! I'm pretty petite (5'2\",5
"Love them!! They aren't see through like many other leggings I've bought, and they are super comfy!",5
"I'm 5\",5
"Maternity is hard to shop for online, so I did need to exchange the size, in store, but other then that they are the best quality leggings I have ever seen or owned. You can tell they will last a while, and they are very smooth and comfortable. I do not plan on putting in the dryer and recommend not, since I can tell it'll shrink and you want a perfect tight fit to begin with.",5
"I bought a pair a few weeks ago and I'm buying another pair today. I'm 34 weeks and packing my hospital bag - these are a must have for that. I can't part with my other pair until delivery so I must have two. Overall, great leggings - very comfy!!",5
"I opened the package and first thought that they were too small and not worth the money. Then I tried them on and literally heaved a deep sigh. They are amazingly comfortable, soft, and stretchy. Most leggings either don't stretch enough, or stretch too much and are see through. I think they are only see through on people that bought a too small size. I imagine I wear these everyday towards to end of pregnancy, to/from home from the hospital etc.",5
"I really like this shirt! Material and style are very flattering, roughed sides and super soft material. I ordered a large which is what I normally wear in regular shirts and this maternity shirt has room for my growing belly. I would say runs a tad big.",5
"I love this tank top! I have one in black and also a white one. Yes, they are a bit more spendy, but SO worth it! Super stretchy material, and they are long enough to wear with leggings.\nI bought my white one about a year ago, And it's still holding up perfectly, so they are really durable. HIGHLY recommend!! [?]",5
"I'm 5'7\",5
"Very comfortable and convenient for nursing. I even like them for support when I'm not nursing. They run small though!",5
"Best nursing hrs i own.,. The best feature is the adjustable band, especially since my ribs are large and I can never find a large enough width. The material is very comfortable and soft. Best purchase I made for nursing bras!",5
"I own 7 of these Tanks in Black I love them. I weigh 245lbs and I am not pregnant but I love the fit of these.Perfect!",5
"I picked these up in-store today.  I don't know why online they aren't just called \",5
"I live in Chicago and wanted a thick legging to wear for the winter. This is perfect, almost as thick as a pant but still the look of leggings. I got the small and am 5'4 so they are a bit long, and the belly panel is loose for me at 20wks. I use the Bumped Cami to help keep them tight and have gotten so many compliments on them. Only have washed a few times so not sure how well they will hold up. Have been turning them inside out so hopefully they wont pill like other reviewers have mentioned.",5
"Every pregnant woman should have a pair of these. In fact, they should come in five different colors. They are so comfortable that once you wear them, you'll realize there is NO point to wearing uncomfortable khaki pants as a pregnant lady.",5
"These are great pants, especially for the price. They are a nice thick legging, so they're warm for winter and not see through at all. I ordered a small and they're a little big for me (for reference, I'm 27 weeks pregnant, 5'4\",5
"These are great! I just bought them today and they are super comfy!! I usually don't wear leggings but I like these enough to wear them :)",5
"These pants are wonderful.  I'm 24 weeks and finally decided to break down and buy a pair of pants as my pre-pregnancy ones are too uncomfortable now.  It's a huge difference! I wish I would have bought them sooner! I like my pants to fit a little tight, I am 5'3'' and usually wear a 4/6 before pregnancy. I had to get an XS in these and I'm glad I did.  They tend to slip down a little throughout the day.",5
"Perhaps Liz Lange updated these pants since the last reviewers tried them, but these are by far the greatest maternity pants I've had. They're extremely comfortable and look great dressed up or dressed down. They do pill a little bit, but I think in my case it's from such constant washing and wearing, so that's to be expected. I'm usually a small-medium pre-pregnancy, and I bought these pants in a small. I would recommend sizing down (I may try an XS for a second pair) because the band tends to loosen a bit and will slide down somewhat easily. Other than that, these are the greatest maternity pants!",5
"Like wearing sweat pants to work! Very comfortable, great for the later stages of pregnancy.",5
"I can't say enough good things about these leggings! They fit great, they are super comfortable, are good quality, and they don't fall down!! Couldn't be happier--highly recommend.",5
"Very comfortable and convenient for nursing. I even like them for support when I'm not nursing. They run small though!",5
"This is the best nursing bra ever! It has the right amount of coverage, holds things in place nicely. It was my absolute favorite, and i had purchased 6!!!",5
"Fits perfectly and feels very comfortable. I love that it is easy to open.",5
"Love, love, love this nursing bra. I've tried many brands/styles and this one is by far the best. Very supportive, comfortable and is great quality. I own a few and wear and wash them every day. They have held up wonderfully. My only suggestion is not to dry them. They will shrink slightly. But other than that, air drying keeps them in perfect condition. Very pleased.",5
"Super comfortable and slimming. The perfect combination after you have a baby!",5
"I have 5 of these tanks in various colors. I am a 36DD pre-pregnancy and even larger while nursing. An XL was a good fit for me. They are quite low cut, so I don't wear them out unless it is underneath another shirt.",5
"It's long enough and not too low cut. It's stretchy and gives you a bit of compression which is exactly what you need after having a baby.",5
"I love this cami. The fabric is really smooth, stretchy and soft. The clip down feature works really well for me and I wear this under my clothes most all of the time right now. It makes nursing so much easier. I also really like the slimming factor. It made my clothes look nicer right after I have birth because it helped to smooth everything out. The price is a little expensive but I will pay it because I do like this cami. I am a 42 DD and the XL works for me. It is fitted",5
"This is perfect for wearing around the house or out under another top.",5
"For all nursing moms, this is a must have. I don't know why I waited so long to get it. But let me tell you, it makes life so much easier! Trust me, you won't regret it. As for size, I'm a 36 D. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.",5
"I pump exclusively, since my bebe refuses to latch, and I finally caved in and bought this hands-free bra. For someone like me, who spends anywhere from 2-3 hours a day pumping, I feel like this is a must-have. It is excellent for sitting and working at the computer. The quality seems to be good, but I just started using it so I can't speak for the long term. I followed the sizing guide and purchased a medium, which has worked perfectly. (I was a 32 DD pre-pregnancy.) I could wish the pump slots were slightly farther apart, but it still works fine. The first time I used it I tried without a nursing bra underneath and I haven't attempted to do so again, due to the difficulty I experienced in safely removing everything without fear of spilling. I have gotten better at taking it off afterwards. I'd say that's the only trouble I've had with this purchase, and it's probably just me being a goon. This definitely makes for a better pumping experience--highly recommend!",5
"I don't know how I used to pump without this bra.  I can now pump and work at the same time or just read a magazine.  The bra itself is very comfortable and fits perfectly.  I would recommend it to anyone who pumps.",5
"Bought this because I couldn't figure out how to have five hands to hold the breast pump in place and help express my milk during pumping. This solved my problem. Can also multi-task while wearing. Good size based on chart. Definite recommend!!",5
"The bustier does what it claims. I wear a 36-38 C while nursing and the large is a good fit for me. It's comfortable but not too big. My hands are free while pumping.",5
"This is a great product and I recommend it to any new mom that is breastfeeding/pumping.",5
"This is a must have for pumping. It makes pumping a lot easier. I can see myself using this a lot in the future.",5
"i cant imagine pumping without this. allows you to be hands free, use laptop, eat, etc. it is good to have more than one so that you have a spare when one is in the wash.",5
"At first I wasn't sure about getting one of these. But I ended up pumping exclusively with my son and wanted someway to be able to multi task while pumping. Although this thing isn't perfect, it certainly does a good job for the price. It fits a little snug but I imagine it has to or it would slide off... it is just a tube top after all. Its comfortable enough for what it is but I will have to see how long it lasts.",5
"This is a must have if you double pump. I found it hard holding with my hands and turning pump on and off. Great quality. I ordered a size up just because I didnt want it to tight and cause restriction. I think regular size would have been fine also.",5
"Very effective and helpful in double pumping.    Good value for the money you spend. Can store in pumping bag and does not take up much room.",5
"[...]  Once I returned to work I used this bra (borrowed from a friend) and I can't imagine pumping without it!  I do not enjoy pumping at all, so being able to do it hands free allows time to pass much more quickly.  I am able to eat lunch, work on my computer, and even write this review as I pump!  My one issue is the zipper - sometimes when I zip it up the bottom comes apart.  Not a big deal, I just unzip it and try again.",5
"Such a simple idea but works so well. This changed my life as far as hands free pumping. The bra is sturdy and holds the pump parts yet is comfortable. The material is not made cheaply. It also seems to make pumping more comfortable.",5
"I knew this would be helpful but I couldn't imagine how much. Our baby ended up in the NICU for 4 weeks so I pumped using this every 3 hours for 4 weeks! It is still useful now that I'm at home and back to work and can get things done while I'm pumping!",5
"I am a 38D with my milk in full supply and I ordered a Large.  Had I been any bigger (and despite their size chart) this bustier would not have fit me.  I would recommend this product to any new mom planning to return to work & needing to pump...or just wanting 2 free hands!",5
"This item is great! It is the best hands free option. I would suggest buying the size that you were in pre-pregnancy. I would normally wear a medium in clothes and ordered this in a Large. Now that I am back to my normal size it is too big on me. It is kind of expensive for what it is though.",5
"I really like this product, but I had to return it the first time I ordered it because it did not fit me.  I am 34 A/B and S was too small for me, but M is just right.  I am probably lucky that the distance between my nipples is the same as the distance between the holes in the bra, but I suspect this will not be the case for everyone.  Overall, it is very functional.",5
"I was so excited to find this in my local Target! I exclusively pump, so I spend a lot of time pumping. Being able to feed and change baby, clip coupons, make grocery lists, read books, etc. while pumping makes my life SO much easier. Unfortunately, within a couple of weeks, the seam started to tear a little, so there is a superficial hole in the top of it. I really should have purchased the next size up. I'm currently a 40DD and purchased a large.It was the only one in the store, though, so I snatched it while I could. I highly suggest this product!",5
"Makes pumping life SO much easier. I would've stopped pumping long before without this bra.  Was 32B pre-baby, 34C post baby and ordered small.  A little tight at first but you want it tight because it will stretch out a bit and you need it tight in order to keep the pump suctioned and for it to stay up.",5
"Buster runs small so buy one size bigger than you think. Also if you can sew at all add a hook at the top so you don't break your zipper. A wonderful accessory. I highly recommend it!",5
"Makes pumping a lot easier. I only wore when pumping to have hands free. The zipper gets stuck but the amount that I use it that is to be expected. I bought several of these between 2 kids.",5
"I was very hesitant to buy at first. All the reviews I read were about broken zippers but I've had no issues. I had a five dollar off coupon that had come in the Madella breast pump that I bought. \",5
"I used this 3 times a day for a year - it was a life saver and held up through many washes and daily abuse. Never had issues with the zipper and found the item to be great quality. Don't know what I would've done without it!",5
"I absolutely LOVE this bustier! I didn't buy one/use one with my first child & pumping time and I don't know how I survived without it. This has made pumping at work so much easier for me. It fits easily under my clothes and allows me to continue working while pumping for my baby!",5
"I purchased this item for my daughter. She loved it as it has allowed her freedom to pump and also do other things at the same time.",5
"Ordered this for my girlfriend and she says it's a life saver!!",5
"I bought this because I was falling asleep while pumping. It works so awesome and I can do other things while pumping instead of doze off. Great Idea!",5
"Couldn't pump without this! Definitely need to purchase this if you plan on pumping!",5
"I pumped every 2 hrs while my son was in the NICU for almost a week and did not have this product, my husband just bought me this 2 weeks ago and now I have no clue how I did without it for so long! Seriously, it's worth the money!!!",5
"If you are serious about pumping and plan on doing it for a while I would recommend this. I did it for about 1 moth w/o this and pumping double was hard, unless my husband was there it start the pump for me. Now that I have this life is much easier on my own. It does fit smaller than a normal bar, so I would go up 1 size to be on the safe side.",5
"This bustier completely frees your hands so that you can do other things (like feed your child a bottle, answer the phone, check email) while you're pumping. The quality is good and it's easy to wash.  I plan to purchase one in black, as well.",5
"Love it!  It works great while freeing up your hands for other things!",5
"It completely does its job for being hands free. It also fits for plus size woman comfortably. The only thing I don't like is the wholes in the bra can be seem through your shirt so you have to wear another bra over. Works great for what I needed it for.",5
"This has got to be the greatest invention ever! I have used this 3 times so far and all 3 times have been great! I wear a 38C and the large fits perfect. I now feel like i have much more time whereas before I had to pump 1 breasted at a time because I could not hold both at the same time. I use mine with my lansinoh pump. I definately reccommend this to any mom that is pumping.",5
"I am a 40DDD and have tried many different nursing bras and this is the best! It is super comfortable! It holds everything in, like a sports bra, so if you are looking for more of a lift this isn't the one, but for comfort and firm support you'll love it!!",5
"most comfortable nursing bra I've tried so far. I was severely engorged during my 1st week postpartum and this bra was a God send. The material is so soft and stretchy. I'm currently a 38DD and have trouble finding comfortable supportive nursing bras, this one is true to size and surprisingly supportive.",5
"I'm normally a 38 DD and I went with the XL. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and everything I read about this bra is true. Not the most supportive but comfortable, true to size, and perfect for lounging around the house feeding a baby while recovering from a c section which is what I will be doing! I highly recommend this bra!",5
"I had a nursing bra from my last baby and it was falling apart because it was my \",5
"40DD and this bra in XL was perfect. Had to return others to get this one in another color--wish there were more color choices! Nice support, comfortable material and easy operation of access panels. This is THE bra to get, especially for large busts!",5
"This nursing bra is more comfortable than the sleep nursing bras I ordered. Not really enough support or \",5
"Didn't think I needed a nursing bra (thought I was special for some reason). Its super comfortable and highly recommend it!",5
"As heavy chested woman I was skeptical about how this bra would fit, but being 8 months pregnant you go more for comfort than looks. It fits perfectly and I am now comfortable to go about my day without the discomfort of normal bras.",5
"I love this bra. I currently have five and between nursing two children (one for 15m and one for 11m now) I have worn out five. Eventually the clasps in the back come apart on all the bras, but other than that I don't have any complaints.\nThe bra is the most comfortable I've found for nursing and pumping. I've tried multiple styles and brands. I've purchased from target, soma, and motherhood maternity and these are the best.its comfy enough to wear day and night.\nI have size large and I'm a 36 DDD. They stretch out a bit and need to be washed to tighten back up.",5
"This was given as a gift to me and I love it! Comfort and easy wear makes me forget there maternity bottoms!",5
"Finally, a bra that fits and supports my large chest and has secure clips/straps for nursing. Also has great coverage. Highly recommend!",5
"After 3 months of nursing my first baby, it was time to find a more supportive, well-fitting bra. I've been wearing the Bravado Basics since delivery, and love them, but they aren't supportive enough for everyday wear.\n\nBased on international measurements, I should be a 42C (but I've yet to find a brand that fits in that size). However, I am a 38 D/E in this bra. Since it comes with a band extender, I can get the perfect fit. It offers great support and isn't restrictive at all -- the cups are very stretchy. I was able to try this on in a maternity store, which I would absolutely recommend. Or at least try several sizes, up and down from your measured size, to get it right.\n\nI don't understand why more people aren't writing positive reviews. I've had several nursing moms recommend this bra to me, which is why I bought one before, and now I'm back for two more!",5
"very comfortable for night and day wear. I think it provides good support without cutting in to my shoulders",5
"I bought this over two years ago and it's held up very, very well! I highly recommend this.",5
"I tried, at least, 5 different/brands of nursing tanks...ranging from this price and higher...this Gilligan O'Malley tank isy ultimate fave.\nSoft fabric and fits well w. my clothes.\n\nNote : I, also, wear a nursing bra.",5
"Great product!!!  I have one in every color.  They could use a little more support for the girls but other than that no complaints.  Makes it easy to feed my son when traveling.",5
"Great through and through. Reviewed the white cami, same product just different colour.\n\nOnce wearing it, the colour seems to stretch in this particular cami.",5
"I love these nursing camis. I first received one as a gift and fell in love. I own 5 now hoping to buy the last two colors soon. You can dress them up or down and it makes nursing in public easier for you and baby also more accessible",5
"This bra is worth every penny! It fits very true to size. It offers great coverage for the plus size woman.",5
"The bra is a must for pumpers! It's made just right as long as you get the right size. I ordered the large first, which was way, way too big. As long as your bra size is smaller than 40 w/ any cup size, no matter how much expansion you have had due to milk, it will work well! The large is just too large for anyone w/ a size 36 or 38 no matter how large the breast itself. That's all folks.",5
"This is in my top 3 favorite baby-related items I bought.  SO nice to have hands free when pumping.  It makes the time go so much faster to be able to type, text, or multi-task.  Also nice when connecting and disconnecting from the pump to make less of a mess.\n\n\n\nI like this bra in particular because-\n\n1. It can be adjusted as your size changes.  I've been pumping for 8 months and have adjusted it multiple times as I've lost baby weight and it continues to fit well.  I was concerned that there are only two sizes, but between the zipper panel and the velcro in the back, it can cover a huge range of sizes.\n\n2.  Washes well.  I've washed multiple times and I accidentally dried it once with no issues.\n\n3.  Price was very good- comparable to other bras.\n\nAll in all, a VERY worthwhile purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone who is going to pump.",5
"This bustier is great! If you're pumping and don't want to sit there and hold the bottles for 20 mins, you need this. Does not cause leakage. Worked better than expected!",5
"I LOVE this bustier. I wish someone had told me about them sooner. I use it when I am getting ready in the morning. In the 10-15 mins it takes for me to brush my teeth, put on my make up and do my hair, I am able to pump at the same time. I actually do not dread having to pump and think it will work out well when I return to work. A much cheaper solution than the Medela hand's free pump. ;)I would recommend it to anyone who needs to pump",5
"Let's face it, pumping is a huge pain, no matter how motivated and determined you are to make it work. This bra makes a huge difference in comfort level and allowing you to relax a bit - use your computer, read a book, have a snack - whatever you choose to do while you're pumping. Fabric is soft and stretchy, nice quality. Yes, I believe others when they say it's easy to cut one out of a sports bra, but this is well worth the money in my opinion!",5
"I'm using the Medela pump and i love this bra, it is very convince for me. It gives me a lot of flexibility to check my emails or text. The velcro is super good! its very tight, which is good",5
"This bra works great--I am using it right now. I am so happy to not have to sit here and hold the shields while pumping.The fabric is soft and stretchy but snug and it comes with some other accessories I haven't used yet, but I am happy with it the way it is. Woo hoo!",5
"I bought this yesterday since i was only pumping 1 oz per breast. I was getting frustrated and tired. I hated holding the bottles in my hands. I bought the XS-L at the store but was worried about the fit since i am 40D. The adjustable velcro in the back makes it fit amazingly. Its snug enough to hold up the bottles, yet not squeezing me to death. This morning, i pumped 7oz in one sitting. Highly recommend!",5
"Love this bra. Changed my whole experience pumping milk. Has made pumping milk much, much more comfortable. You can work online and get things done with this bra. Its very well made, well designed, and easy to use. I can't say enough about it. You may be reluctant to spend almost $40 on yet another baby related purchase, but I assure you...this is a must have if your a pumping mother. No regrets!",5
"The Lansinoh arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I opened it and it is sooo much better! It has many options for size.  It has extensions and it  works so great I couldn't have designed one any better than this thing. I'm very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints at all. Lansinoh did a great job with this product.",5
"Whoever invented this deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.",5
"I wasn't sure I'd end up using this...like maybe it would be hassle. It is worth every penny, as it is quick and easy to put on and you can save time by doing all kinds of things with your hands while you're pumping...writing, typing, eating, using the TV remote... :)",5
"Absolutly love the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier!!! It is easy to use, comfortable and allows you to do other things while pumping. A must have for breastfeeding moms!!",5
"Buying this product is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Although I am blessed to have a workplace that is very supportive with me having to pump a few times a day, I was always very frustrated that I could not get much work done during those times because I was having to hold up the breast shields. This bra holds the shields securely in place and allows me to keep working while I pump. I couldn't ask for anything more! Such a great purchase!",5
"I am in love with this hands free pump bustier. I wish I had it for my first baby. Pumping before was always awkward. I would always hunch over the horns and I could never get anything done. What I love about this bustier is that you can adjust the size both with the velcro on the back and the zipper panel in the front. I am also able to assist the pumping with massage since I could make it as tight or as loose as I wanted it. The only downside I am able to see is the awkwardness of getting out of it, but that doesn't even compare to the awkwardness of not having it! This is fantastic and this is a total MUST for any pumping mom!",5
"This is the perfect bra for a working, typing, reading mother!!! This is the only bra I have ever bought and my child is a little over 6 months. I started using it when he was about 2 months. I take it to work everyday and use it twice a day 5 days a week. It stays in my Medella backpack. It holds the shields in place for true hands-free pumping. In fact, I am pumping as I am typing this review. I wash it in the washer and hang it up to dry. I only wear it when I am pumping though so I am not sure of its longevity if you wear it as a regular bra on some days. Thankfully, my job has a place I can pump in peace behind a closed door. I do like the fact that it has an adjustable back. I definitely have used it since I have lost about 15 pounds since giving birth (mostly due to exclusively breastfeeding). The only slight issue is that the zipper started to give a bit. I thought it was stripped at one point. But, it is still working. I am considering buying another one in a few more months. But, for the wear and tear and price, this one is holding up well, all things considered.",5
"I wear DDD pre-pregnancy and G while nursing. An XL / Large Plus fits great with room to spare. Material is soft and zipper is easy to use. Great high quality product. Use several times a day and love it!",5
"Just tried this product after reading reviews and I love it! I have the medela pump and this slips right into it. It is really comfortable fabric and it has a velcro piece in the back that is adjustable. It's really nice to not have to hold the pump.",5
"I've been using this bustier for two weeks now, and although I had to adjust to taking the time to put it on and get the pump's flanges perfectly in place before starting, I'm very happy with it now. It's totally worth the initial set-up time because I can wash bottles while I pump, read a book, etc. The bra is highly adjustable and will go much bigger or smaller, which is great because it ensures a very good fit. It's well made and stays put, and it holds up the bottles even when they're full, though I prefer to lean forward and rest them on the counter. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and am so glad I bought it despite our tight budget- this truly was an investment that is paying off!",5
"I bought this bra so I could pump while I typed on the computer.  Works great, I don't get the annoying marks on my arms trying to hold the cups up like I used to.  The bra keeps the cups up so I don't have to hold them at all.",5
"Love this one...easier to put on, better coverage, and better fit. Should have bought this one first!",5
"This fits wonderfully and stays in place. I was skeptical of a bra that was designed to fit women size xs-L but it does! I am xs and it uses strong Velcro to switch sizes. It helps to free up my arms so that I can care for my twins while pumping. Great quality too.",5
"I have only used the bustier a couple times so far, but it was easy to put on and use. Its much easier to pump now that my hands are free.",5
"I'm pumping exclusively to feed my daughter, and this has been a huge help! Its comfortable and allows me to be hands-free while pumping, which adds up to quite a lot of time during the day. I'd highly recommend this!",5
"I just returned to work 1 month ago, and our little guy is now 3 months old. I used to hate pumping with our first son, because I felt like I was wasting so much time at work. Now I welcome pumping as a time to catch up on paperwork or reading. I'm a pediatrician, and I recommend this to friends and patients. Of all of the fancy gear we've accumulated for our little ones, this is my favorite. Absolutely worth the price.",5
"I am currently wearing size 40F bras. I had my doubts about this bra since there were only two sizes to choose from, but it is perfect. There is a large strip of hook and loop fabric for the back and a strip of fabric to zip in front, making it easily possible to customize this bra. I can email and text and even put on makeup while pumping with this bra. I highly recommend this bra for any woman of any size!",5
"Nursing my fist child, I didn't have this, so pumping was such a chore & took a lot of time away from things.  At work, I ended up skipping a session here & there, of which I underestimated the consequences.  I was struggling by 5 months to keep nursing.  With my second child, I learned about this bustier at a pump class and it has made a HUGE difference.  I can pump much more often than I would have without it.  I travel with it, and actually have been able to pump (with a nursing shawl to cover me) at an airport terminal, on an airport shutltle van & actually on the airplane with someone next to me.  I am able to pump hands free and look at pictures of my baby, eat lunch, drive (although not recommended I'm sure), etc.  I've made so much use of my driving time because of this bustier.  I'd say that over 50% of my pumping sessions happen in the car.  It's totally adjustable, can wear over sweaters or just nursing bra.  The adjustability comes in handy when you lose your baby weight or go through seasons.  I can honestly say I have maintained my milk supply because of this bustier.  My 2nd child is 8.5 months old today and no sign of my milk supply diminishing!  I recommend this to everyone I know.  Get one! I couldn't stand pumping the first time around because I felt trapped.  This time around, it's tolerable; just a slight nuisance.  ;)",5
"This is such a great addition to the occasional or every-day pumping mama. I own the Medela Freestyle pump and the clips do not fit with any other bra, especially the bras I purchased. I am very large chested with a small band size and had to put the Medela bra on, strap on all the clips and hold very still, every time I wanted \",5
"LOVE THIS! It's very comfortable and works with Medela just fine. I also have the Medela Pumping Bra and this one is much more comfortable and has stayed up instead of sliding down. I really like how you can adjust the size of it as well! What a great feature!",5
"I am almost exclusively pumping for my newborn daughter, so I'm spending a lot of time pumping. After making lots of messes and getting frustrated trying to do other things while double pumping, I decided to spend the cash and try this out due to the good reviews. I love it! I was worried it might be too small since I am right on the line between a XS/S/M size and a L/XL size, but I am glad I got the smaller size. The extra panel that zips into the front makes it just the right size for my large chest and it holds the pumps firmly to my breasts without leaking. I'm very happy I spent the money - totally worth it.",5
"Love this product! I pump for my LO, and at times I will be pumping while eating, feeding my LO, and maybe on the phone, all at the same time! It used to take me between 30-60 mins to pump, because of this pumping bra, it takes me 15-30 mins tops! The bra is adjustable to your ribcage size, and is not a thick material, so I can still do what I need to do when I have a case of mastitis. Definitely recommend this product!",5
"This bra makes it so comfortable and easy to pump. Before I had this bra I didn't seem to get a lot of milk when I pumped but now that I can search on my phone or play with baby while pumping I seem to get a lot more where my mind is on something else and I am relaxed. Buy this bra if you want to make your life a little easier.",5
"Makes pumping so much easy ,this is a must have I love how I can feed my son or be on the phone while I pump !",5
"Hands free pumping? YES PLEASE!! Do more while you pump! With the hands free bra, I am able to wash all of the bottles and storage supplies while I pump! Become more efficient by maximizing your time!!!",5
"The first few weeks with a newborn are overwhelming, and it seems we can barely find time to do anything other than pump and breastfeed. With this bra I was able to do something so basic-EAT! It seems silly, but when you have a newborn multi-tasking is your best friend. I loved my bra and even got one for my sister in law. The bra is so well adjusted and ensures a secure fit so you don't lose and of that liquid god.",5
"I am a mother of 3 and am always multi-tasking. With this bra I am able to have both hands free to fold laundry and even eat dinner! It is extremely comfortable and fully adjustable! I recommend this hands-free pumping bra for nursing/pumping moms, no matter what size your bust!",5
"I used this when my son was a newborn. Super easy to use and a nice tool. Fits perfectly!",5
"I own two of these simple wishes hands free pumping bras! I love them and make pumping so much easier and convenient;. The bra is very comfortable too and can be adjusted to fit your body. I tried multiple brands before finding this one and am so glad I did. It has made pumping a breeze and makes my nighttime routine so much easier. I highly recommend this pumping bra to anyone! The bra is flexible, the material is so soft, it fits your breasts nicely the way the fabric fits the curves of the body, the bra is adjustable to your body time (all the other brands I tried did not), and it makes my life much easier when I'm pumping.",5
"its very easy to use!",5
"The bra makes pumping so much easier and if using a double pump a must have. Great product.",5
"I love this for ease during pumping. The few times I was without make you appreciate it more!",5
"This product gave me so much freedom (and still does)! I don't know how I ever lived without it!",5
"This hands-free pumping bra saved my life! Okay, a little dramatic, but it made my pumping experience so much better. I exclusively pumped and this gave me the chance to multi-task while hooked up to my pump 5 times a day. It was comfortable and held the shields securely in place. I would definitely recommend getting yourself a few if you're still nursing when you go back to work, or are exclusively pumping.",5
"This is the best hands free bra! It's tight and sturdy but also a large size so that it can fit ladies of of shapes and sizes. It is easy to put on too.",5
"I LOVE this product!!! This is one product that I use nearly everyday. Whether I pump at home or at work, it makes pumping so much easier. I knew from the 1st time I used it that it was worth every penny I paid for it. I wish I would have had it years ago when I started breastfeeding. Its easy to use, comfortable, very soft material, pretty color. Very pleased!!!",5
"Easy to use- a must have for moms going back to work and pumping. Very well made",5
"I just got this the last weekend and I love it. I got it in the light pink. It is easy to adjust to size and is comfy. Easy to put on and use. It helps get a great suction on my breasts and makes doing thing in the house so easy! Recommended for anyone that pumps!",5
"While using this, I'm able to get things done while pumping for my baby. It's comfortable and easy to use!",5
"I've tried 4 different pumping bras and this is the only one I like and keep going back to. It's adjustable which is great. And it's pretty discreet which is great when I have to pump in the car.",5
"As an exclusive pumping mom for both of my daughters this is a A life saver!!! I wouldn't have pumped for over a year with my first without and currently my 7 month old we are still going strong. I recommend this to everyone it had made life so much easier at home and work!! I'm pumping while writing this review!",5
"With having a two year old running around and a new baby this bra was a life saver. It's easy to put on and be able to pump without the hassle of holding the suction cups of the breast pump.",5
"Keeps the pumps in place, can move around room just no fast movemts. Does not lose its shape after washing either.",5
"I pumped for over a year after a surrogate pregnancy and donated to a milk bank for preemies. Let me just say - I could not have made it without this hands free bra! If you are going to pump AT ALL, I HIGHLY recommend this bra!! I cannot say enough good things about it.",5
"Very comfortable and practical item. Recommended",5
"I use this everyday to pump at work; fits great, comfy, and makes pumping so relaxing.",5
"This product is amazing. I have been using it almost everyday and it has been a lifesaver. I have a newborn, a one year old and a five year old so I need something that allows me to use my hands doing other things. I love how you can adjust the size of the bra to fit your exact size.",5
"I have twins and a 3 year old. before i got this i was constantly spilling milk because i was trying to do things to help my toddler while holding the pump with my forearms and it would drop and spill and was a disaster lol. this is a bit pricey but totally worth it. as a mom, having your hands free is completely priceless! i cannot imagine life without this anymore lol",5
"I tried several hands-free pumping bras and this one is my favorite! It adjusted to fit you, super easy to use, easily cleaned and comfortable!!!",5
"This is a great product and true to size. I pump at work and instead of needing to hold the pumps I am able to put on this bra and let the bra do all the holding while I relax or even have a chance to eat a snack. This has made pumping very easy.",5
"Love that you can use this product while checking email and working. Th bra allows you to pump and do other things at the same time. The best part of the bra is it stays up without the straps and is adjustable...as your weight shifts after giving birth, you can tighten the bra as needed (with velcro). Allows one bra to work the entire post pregnancy nursing. BEST PRODUCT & a time saver. I use it at work when I'm in a lactation room and continue working on my computer without having to hold any of the parts. I recommended to a couple co-workers and they are all very happy with how this bra has helped them be more efficient and spend less time at work making up for lost time while pumping.",5
"Ok so pumping is time consuming and can be boring. And as much as a mom pumps, it can take a lot of time away from you. I love this bra because it goes perfectly with my Lansinoh Signature Pro Double Electric Breast Pump! Its cute and I like the light pink color so it's feminine. It is actually pretty comfy too. I love the full frontal zipper which I think is totally awesome and makes it easy to use and put on and take off. It comes with straps that attach easily so you can wear it like a regular bra, as a racer back or cross strapped or halter or just as is as a strapless bra. I love this though because it makes pumping so much easier now that I dont have to hold the pump with my hands. It's easy to set up and you just insert the pump through the flaps, and they hold up really well and it works great. I have had no problems. It is like the epitome of fashionable and functional! Since using this, I can still do some of the things I need to like fold laundry, peel potatoes in front of the tv, give attention to my baby, etc! The fabric is really soft and comfy. It's kind of a stretchy material too. And it definitely makes it easier to pump since you don't have to hold them up yourself. I just wish I had one of these for when I was pumping for my other 2 children. I did receive this product for free as part of a product trial program but the experience and opinions are my own.",5
"The Simple Wishes hands free bra is a life saver. I am an exclusive pumper and have been pumping for almost 17 months. The first two month without the bra was so hard that I wanted to quit. When I got the hands free bra I was able to do things while I pumped like hold and feed my baby. It also reduced the movement of the flanges while I pump which eliminates the milk dripping out caused by my hand slipping and soaking my clothes.",5
"Absolutely love this product. It makes double pumping a breeze and so relaxing.",5
"I love this product! I am a mom of a 3 year old and an eight month old and I am an exclusive pumper and this product helps me be able to pump and to make sure that my toddler isn't getting into anything while I am busy. I hook up to the pump and am still able to walk around and do stuff. I wish I would of had this when I was pumping with my first, it would of helped our so much! One of the best things I have ever bought!",5
"After exclusively breastfeeding for 12 weeks, I had to go back to work. I ordered this hands free bra the first day back on the job, as it was so frustrating to not be able to move while pumping. I was worried about the fit, as I am a very plus sized woman. The bustier fits well, although don't think you are going to wear it all day. It is definitely a \",5
"After breastfeeding my daughter for 5 months I decided to break down and get a pumping bra. I hesitated because I only pump at night, it was just another thing to lug around and put on. What a mistake!! I don't know how but I pump so much more and efficiently than ever before. Plus my hands are free. Ladies, do yourself a favor and get this bra!",5
"I love this product. I use it daily!! The adjustable straps are amazing and easy to use.",5
"I have not returned to work yet, but this does help me tremendously! I would also like to think that using the bustier also helps get the most of my milk versus my holding it with my hands! Plus my arms don't get tired!",5
"I wish I would have purchased this sooner, but I had waited a week to figure out that it was needed! I am an exclusive pumper so this was worth the money. This bra allows you to truly be \",5
"Thick material, stays up well, completely adjustable with heavy-duty velcro. Comes with optional straps (I assume they are to be used if you wear this as your real bra). Wish it were cheaper but it seems average for pumping bras.",5
"I have a preemie so I'm pumping after every feeding and this bra has made it SO much better! Before I didn't have enough hands to even feel comfortable turning the dials on my pump, now I'm writing this review as I do it. Definitely worth the money!",5
"I bought this bustier yesterday after finding myself needing to pump both breasts in order to heal some sore nipples. It made what was going to be a very exhausting few days a little less exhausting. The bra is adjustable and I was able to find the perfect fit. It holds the flanges in place quite snugly, and allows me to use my hands to do other things to pass the time. I use it with my Medela pump, and it works beautifully. I highly recommend making the investment if you find yourself needing to pump for an extended amount of time.",5
"Easy to put on and can really pump hands free. Glad I purchased it. Can pump and do other things (like go on the computer and write a review!) at the same time. Runs on the small side though. I wear a Med/Large and I adjusted it to the widest possible fit.",5
"This has been super helpful. It makes life so much easier when you don't have to hold the bottles while you pump. I can use my time more wisely now while I pump.",5
"I haven't tried any other hands free systems, so cannot compare, but this has been most helpful as I pump. I'm a 32H bra size, thanks to my daughter, and this fits well and provides the support needed while pumping. It comes with an included halter strap, which I don't even need.",5
"This hands free bra made pumping much more comfortable for me. Holding the flanges against my chest was getting really old! I'm not getting up doing anything crazy while I pump, but it's nice to be able to drink some water, use the computer mouse or remote, or pat my baby while pumping. The bra is very snug around me right now but the zipper is quite sturdy and so is the velcro in the back. I have been using this item about twice/day for 2 weeks at home and everything is holding up so far. I take it on and off each time, so it adds a few minutes to the pumping procedure. If you have a small chest and pump frequently, you could probably wear it around as your bra under a thick structured and/or patterned shirt, but there are no cups - it is a flat compression style - so \",5
"I bought a different pumping bra, and it was ok, but this one is SO much better. More comfortable, adjustable, and feels like it's better quality. All you working breastfeeding mamas - get this one!",5
"This bra is made very well. It hold the flanges onto the breast great and allows for true hands free double pumping. I wear a size 44DDD (maybe a bit larger cup now because of the milk) and this bra works great. It doesn't offer underwire type support, but it holds the girls up enough to get the job done well.\nI recommend this bra to anyone pumping. Set up time for pumping takes a bit longer at first, especially if you have large breasts, but you get used to it quickly. The material is soft, the bra offers adjustability for size and comes with straps to help hold you up.\nIf there was any way to improve the bra, it would be that I'd love to be able to wear it while breastfeeding and be able to pump the other breast at the same time.",5
"This worked perfectly for me. It's fully adjustable in the back so you can get if fit exactly like you need it. Holds the flanges up snugly to my body so I can pump hands free.",5
"This bra is the best... Don't waste your time and money buying the other brand.... The quality, effectiveness, and flexibility this bra provides makes it the easy choice",5
"Great fit! Would really fit a wide range of sizes. Having the hands free is really nice.",5
"I love this bra, I hated pumping before I bought it but now its so much easier since I can multi-task.\nLove that it comes with straps and you can choose which side to wear it on. Also love the velcro back, adjustable to your personal size. And its really soft material which is great for when you're engorged.",5
"I tried another bra and this was one is FAR superior. My other bra eventually stretched out and there was no way to tighten it. This bra has a zipper in the front and velcro in the back in case you need to tighten it over time. I also LOVE the shoulder straps...just gives you the added support in case you produce a lot of milk ;) I HIGHLY recommend this breast pump bra. You won't be disappointed.",5
"Perfect for the multi-tasking pumper.",5
"My only regret is waiting until 6 months of pumping and nursing to buy this bra! So much more comfortable and easy to use.",5
"After trying ( and returning) the medela pump bra, I ordered the Lansinoh based on its great reviews. It's adjustable, the fabric is high quality, I use it several times a day. It's a bit expensive but worth it if you want your hands free while you pump.",5
"This makes my commitment of being a working mother that nurses so much easier. No complaints. Works perfectly!",5
"This product does wonders , so happy I ordered it!",5
"I have used this bustier every day since I got it! It's supportive and you really can go hands free. Great for the mommy of two!",5
"Great product, I'm a 40DD",5
"This bra is made really well. I love how you can really work it to fit your size. I am a pre-pregnancy 34C, and an EE while breastfeeding. They have made this bra very easy to adjust and I love that. You do want it to fit pretty tight so that it holds the shields and bottles in place. I have had zero problems with this bra, and find that it is a lot easier than holding both bottles in place, even if I'm not multitasking! Would definitely recommend for any nursing mom.",5
"By far the best one. It fits best, is adjustable, and holds the pumps in place perfectly!",5
"Easy to use and comfortable.  Has made pumping so much easier.  In my opinion, a must have if planning to pump on a regular basis.",5
"I came across this bra with my second baby and I can honestly say this is the best purchase I've made!!  It has allowed me to keep up with pumping every three hours, while caring for both my 3 month old and 2 year old. It's so easy to strap on and I can go about my daily life (within reach of an outlet).  I pump while eating with my family, changing diapers, using the computer, and just playing with my kids. I even pump driving down the road with my nursing cover on. I HIGHLY recommend this item!!!",5
"Second time mom and wished I had ordered this previously with my first child. I exclusively pump and it makes it so much easier. Definitely a must!! Love the adjustable bands and the options to add straps if desired.",5
"Have used this a few times and its great to be able to have full use of my hands while pumping. I like to compress and massage to get the most milk out and I can do that with this bra. A little pricey but they all seem to be about the same amount",5
"I love this product!  I pump at least 4 times a day for 20 minutes.  I was getting tired of sitting in an uncomfortable position holding the pump parts.  This bra works really well-it is comfortable and it holds the pump pieces in place.  Now I can  work on the computer or read a book!  LOVE IT!",5
"I read the reviews before purchasing and they were correct! I recommend everyone that is pumping gets one. One reviewer said that if you are between sizes to go with the smaller one. That was my situation however it was a close fit. I have to use the extender in the front and I have it on the last of the velcro on the back. I did not try the next size up however so I don't know if that would have been too big or not. Overall great product!",5
"[...] I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality! Soft fabric, well made and very adjustable. This will make pumping so much easier for people!",5
"Love it! I bought 2 pumping bras to compare. Right out the box, I decided to keep this one and return the medela one. This one has shoulder straps, strong adjustable velcro and an extender piece. Lots of options to create the perfect fit! Soft pink material is very comfy. Definitely worth the cost for comfort and hands-free freedom!",5
"I did a lot of shopping around for the best price and highest rated bra for pumping. This had great reviews but I was worried about the one size fits all. This bra has been perfect. Very comfy and easy to use. The zipper is high quality unlike others. Allows for good suction for pumping.",5
"Fits great\nEasy to adjust",5
"Works great! Ordered the L/XL/XXL. There are many ways to adjust it for the right fit. Gets the job done hands free. Very convenient. Great invention!",5
"I just used this for the 1st time at work and it makes pumping at work so much more comfortable. I was actually able to enjoy my pump break with reading a few pages in a great book. I haven't had time to read a book for fun in FOREVER. This product is true to size (as I am on the cusp of small and large, but ordered the small like the chart said) and very comfortable. I am going to recommend this to EVERYONE i know who is pumping!!!",5
"I am a first time mother, so I was new to pumping. I took a gamble and purchased this product after someone told me their sister uses it. I am thrilled! I no longer feel a slave to pumping. I am actually pumping both breasts while writing this review. Make your life easier and get the bustier!",5
"While this bra may not be the most attractive in appearance, it more than makes up for it in function. The openings in the cups provide great support for your breast pump flanges. The adjustable velcro back ensures great comfort and fit, even as your body changes back to it's pre-pregnancy state. Best of all, your hands are free to tackle other tasks while pumping! A true asset to all multi-tasking women!",5
"I bought this first to feel like my belly was more supported. I am already having some \",5
"I'm only 5 ft tall and it's hard to find pants that fit well.  This band has allowed me to stay in my \",5
"I started to grow out of my pants at about 3 months, I'm at 8 months now and this maternity band is still going strong. Maternity pants can be expensive, this was a great alternative.",5
"Love it! Able to fit in my pre-mat clothes still at 22 weeks, with a little waistband help from the bellaband!",5
"My wife bought this and has found it very useful. Good Product and Value.",5
"This is perfect for filling in some extra space between your pants and your shirt. It also helps with keeping pants that are too big up or just smoothing out that section a little bit.",5
"I would recommend to anyone who wants to save money on buying new maternity pants. This really helps make any pants fit. I like that you can use it for jeans and for dressy pants since 2 are with buttons and the others with hooks. I love it great money saver!",5
"I wear a uniform to work and at 10 weeks I'm already busting out of my uniform. I want to wait until I'm in my 2nd trimester to share the news at work, so I bought this in hopes of buying some time until I break the news and can wear civilian clothes. They are awesome and extremely comfortable. I've also used them in my jeans that have gotten a little snug and they work perfectly. Highly recommend!!!!",5
"I should have gotten this so much earlier in my pregnancy. Super easy to use, and let me get back into a few pants I had given up on over a month ago. Currently am 5 months along, and am just now starting to use the longer of the two belts (pre-pregnancy pants size 8). The \",5
"I ordered this for use during that awkward phase of pregnancy where you dont quite fit your old jeans but you're not quite big enough for maternity jeans.  I am barely showing so I used to shortest extender in the package and it worked very well.  While using the extender my zipper stayed up and my jeans still felt like I was wearing them the normal way. I would definitely recommend this to other prego's.",5
"This is a really great product. I am almost 5 months pregnant and it has been wonderful to be able to still wear my pre-pregnancy clothes, and with the different sizes it looks like I might be able to get through the whole pregnancy using this.",5
"This did everything it promised. I used it only for postpartum but i think the entire kit would work especially well for the early weeks of pooching during pregnancy.",5
"Love this belt, it's great for saving money and staying in your current jeans without having to buy ugly maternity pants!",5
"It is very easy to use. I love the fact it can be adjusted throughout your entire pregnancy. Works very well with my jeans and dress pants for work.",5
"I absolutley love this kit!! It works perfectly for those pre pregnancy pants that just barely wont button! I am so excited that they make this!!",5
"This kit comes with belly belts of 2 sizes. I am using the smaller one and love it. It just extends the belt and thats all I need for now. I am wearing my regular jeans and trousers and feel v comfortable. Love it!",5
"Great item to have, instead of buying those expensive, unflattering maternity jeans. Comes in different sizes as your belly grows! Must have!",5
"Is a very usefull piece, you can wear all your clothes whenyou are pregnant and do not fit into pregnancy clothes. I do recommed this product.",5
"This item is a great purchase to make in early pregnancy. If you are a small person and will possibly outgrow your clothes very quickly once your waist stars to thicken, this is a great way to keep being able to wear your pre-pregnancy clothes.",5
"My daughter got these in the mail as a surprise from me. Timing was perfect they were going out to a party and she wasn't showing much but when she went to put on the pants she wanted to wear they were not going to button. She was so happy I had just sent these and she was able to finish dressing in the outfit she planned and was really excited about having these, She loves theim!",5
"This is a great button extender. It stays on, looks good and helped me wear my pre-pregnancy clothes through month 5.",5
"This product offers a great way to fit in regular clothes in the early months of pregnancy. I hope to use it through my pregnancy and since it expands I think I will be able to. This is a great idea and I just love it!!",5
"I really got a lot of use out of the Belly Belt. I bought it when i found out i was pregnant and i was able to keep wearing my work clothes and jeans for six months of my pregnancy. After my son was born i went back to using the Belly Belt instead of wearing the maternity pants for a more comfortable fit. I love that the kit comes with two different size belts and a set with hooks for dress pants!!",5
"This product is great! I use it with all of my jeans! I tell all my friends about this product that is pregnant!",5
"I have three pairs of my favorite Express jeans and thanks to the belly belt I am still able to wear them at 7  mos prego. It is just now starting to wear and tear but I wear it almost every day. I dont use the fabric it came with because its not very useful. [...]",5
"I absolutely love the Belly Belt! It has helped me to stay in my pre-pregnancy jeans comfortably. I have no complaitns whatsoever",5
"This belly band is a life saver so far. I am in my second trimester & so far the belly band is holding up pretty well. I'm hoping the belly band works well into my last trimester so that I can wear my jeans a little longer instead of shopping for maternity pants.",5
"I am now 15 weeks pregnant with my second child and have just purchased a Belly Belt. It is seriously the best maternity purchase I have ever made.I am still wearing my pre-pregnancy jeans and plan to for the remainder of my pregnancy, with Belly Belt.I find the belts and material really handy - they pull my jeans together while giving me that extra bit of room and I have used the maternity a couple of times, I found it to sit very well.Great Buy... recommend to everyone.",5
"This is my second pregnancy and my how I wish I would have found this with the first one! I used the belly band during my first pregnancy and I saw the belly belt this time around and had to give it a try. This thing is AMAZING! I am 14 weeks and very small framed (size 0) and this is perfect for all of my pre pregnancy jeans, shorts and slacks. It is not bulky at all and you can't even tell that I am wearing it, even under tighter shirts. I would highly recommend this to any mom to be!!",5
"I am very petite and had enough trouble finding pants to fit before I got pregnant. Having the Belly Belt is a life saver!!! Hopefully the two sizes will get me through my entire pregnancy so that I won't even have to buy maternity pants! I would recommend this product to anyone that is pregnant! It will save you a ton of money in the long run!!",5
"ok!!! so- I am now 8 months pregnant and still wearing my regular clothes. I am by no means a small pregnant woman. My belly is huge and I wear a size 14 pant (pre-pregnancy) and am still wearing them thanks to the Belly Belt! Really- I have saved a ton of money because I did not have to buy new professional clothing to wear to work, I just use the belly belt in my slacks and wear longer (maternity) shirts to cover the fact that my zipper is down. I will say though- I do not like the inserts that come with the belt- they just ride up and come out- so I just leave my zipper down(no one can see it anyways) I am still giving this product 5 stars though! Great invention!",5
"I am 22 weeks now and I simply love this! If my blouse is long enough, i wear it on its own, or else I will slide on a belly band to cover up. Recommended for all pregger ladies!",5
"These were thick (but not hot) great quality leggings with a super comfy belly panel. I'm usually a S; I bought a S and have plenty of room to grow. Definitely no need to size up - maybe even a tad large. Also, I'm a long-legged 5'5\",5
"I'm about 20 weeks pregnant and I got these leggings. They are super comfortable. I think there will be plenty of room for me to \",5
"These leggings are the best! They are not sheer at all and still very breathable. They are VERY soft. I find a lot of the panels on maternity pants to be itchy...these are not itchy at all. I could live in these leggings! :)",5
"I love these pants, they are so comfortable. I wish they had different colors, I want to wear them everyday.",5
"Just got these and I love them. They are thicker than tights but not quite as thick as a solid cotton pant. There are no weird, pany-hose like seams on the thighs, so if your shirt isn't full tunic length, you will still be okay! The belly panel is comfy, and the length is perfect - I am 5'6 and they gather just a SMIDGE at my ankles, which I like because it makes them look little more like slim fit trousers than just leggings. If you are short though, you may not like this. The only possible problem I see is that because they do have that tights-like stretch to them, they may not hold up in the knees for very long. This may not be a problem for most, but I have an active 2 year old who I play with a lot on the floor, crawling around and whatnot, so these may not stand the test of toddler time :) But, we'll see.",5
"Bought these at 26 weeks and have been wearing for the past 1.5 months. They are the MOST comfortable article of clothing I own at the moment. Have held up well, and I plan to wear them through the rest of the pregnancy. I am 5'7\",5
"I just had my 3rd child and desperately needed new nursing bras. After searching for nearly a month I came across this sleep bra online. I wasn't sure if the fit would work or not but I still ordered one in black and one in the dark red. Once I recieved them I tried it on and absolutely love the fit. There's not much support but I wasn't looking for that - I wanted a good sleep bra or bra to wear around the house. The lacy, almost see through material makes me feel a little sexier too compared to other sleep bras I've had or seen. Overall I highly recommend this bra - great fit, looks great & feels great.\nFor reference I'm a 38D.",5
"I bought these 3 days ago and never want to take them off. I'm 7 months pregnant, pre-pregnancy size 8 pants, and the S/M size fits me perfectly. They don't squeeze too tight or fall down. I plan on wearing them all winter to stay warm and I'm sure they'll come in handy post-partum as my body heals and I want some belly coverage.",5
"I am really happy with these leggings. I was nervous because the biggest size offered was a M/L, when in pre-pregnancy I am a size 16 pant, but they fit amazing! They are super comfortable and soft, I feel like I could wear them all the time. They do fall down a little at the top, but since, as a pregnant woman, I use the restroom every few hours, I just adjust them then. This has been my best maternity clothes purchase so far! I'm 20 weeks, so I hope these fit till the end, cause they are great!",5
"Soft stretchy material. They do not cut into the top of my stomach like most leggings if I decide to wear full panel and don't hurt my lower abdomen if I wear them under my bump either. Every pregnant girl should get a pair (or two) of these. I plan to wear these post pregnancy as well. This time around, I'll be prepared with comfy clothes to wear in the hospital and around the house after delivery and these definitely make the cut. Enjoy!",5
"Funny story-- I saw this on my friend at her baby shower and I had been looking for some opague comfy leggings for under dresses and what not (hate tights). Did I mention I am not even pregnant? These are awesome-- thick and warm and I just folded over the top of the pant like a yoga pant. I have since bought three more! Definitely recommend this to anyone!",5
"Tried these on at the store and fell in love. Soft fabric and opaque enough to wear a shorter top. Love that they are not constricting even when you bend or sit for awhile. Pre-pregnancy I was a 6 so I went with the smallest size. Many reviews stated that they would fall down, but I haven't had that problem. I'll definitely use these after my pregnancy.",5
"I'm about a size 18 or 15 pre pregnancy. I got the Large and they are perfect! I do not have a problem with them falling down. I haven't noticed them being see through either. I'm currently 6 months pregnant. They are pretty long. I'm 5'7 and they go all the way to my ankle .",5
"so happy I purchased these leggings - they are the most comfortable pregnancy accessory I have so far!  They are great to wear with skirts/dresses or with a tshirt when hanging out around the house - super comfortable!  I'm 5'5\",5
"I've had a terrible time finding maternity pants or leggings that fit me well (aren't too saggy, always sliding down, too tight around the belly, etc). I'm 5'8\",5
"Absolutely love these! I'd definitely recommend for pregnancy as well as post-pregnancy! Very comfy and great for recovery from c-section!",5
"Love these! Extra band at top for belly support and they are thick enough to not be see thru! I am 22 weeks now, 5'5 and weighing 173...ordered a medium and they fit perfectly.",5
"Pre pregnancy I was a size 10, 170 lbs, 57, i tried on small medium and medium large and although the sm fit well, i felt that they were see through, the ml also fit and werent as stretched out so were more opaque and less see through, i bought the ml and LOVE the softness and versatility of these leggings. Ill admit they do slip a little but not enough that i have to wear my belly band with it. The leggings do feel like they dont goall the way up my crotch area but after readjusting in the bathroom they are fine, since were there every half hour. Overall i think the pros outweigh the cons to these leggings, i ended up buying a second pair, i gave it four stars because they do slip a bit. I wish they came in different colors.",5
"I am one of the people who love these! I find that they are not too tight on my belly and don't press my bladder along with everything else. I do see how some can say they do not stay up all the way, but it does not bother me, it's not like they are falling off at all. As far as other people saying they are see through I do not agree. Perhaps they need a bigger size because it's stretched to the fullest. I find these comfortable, and not too tight. I don't like when I'm being squeezed too hard by pants! I have worn these a few times-and can see myself wearing them all throughout my pregnancy. I wish I had these with my last pregnancy! Good luck to all those searching for some decent leggings... I would highly recommend these or at least give them a try! I am a size 6 and 4mos. small fits perfectly.",5
"These leggings are amazing.......so soft and comfy...AND they actually look adorable on too =) I'm 5 months along with my 5th and always avoided buying maternity leggings before, but I couldn't resist these, they are just that comfy! I'm pretty petite (5'2\",5
"Love them!! They aren't see through like many other leggings I've bought, and they are super comfy!",5
"I'm 5\",5
"Maternity is hard to shop for online, so I did need to exchange the size, in store, but other then that they are the best quality leggings I have ever seen or owned. You can tell they will last a while, and they are very smooth and comfortable. I do not plan on putting in the dryer and recommend not, since I can tell it'll shrink and you want a perfect tight fit to begin with.",5
"I bought a pair a few weeks ago and I'm buying another pair today. I'm 34 weeks and packing my hospital bag - these are a must have for that. I can't part with my other pair until delivery so I must have two. Overall, great leggings - very comfy!!",5
"I opened the package and first thought that they were too small and not worth the money. Then I tried them on and literally heaved a deep sigh. They are amazingly comfortable, soft, and stretchy. Most leggings either don't stretch enough, or stretch too much and are see through. I think they are only see through on people that bought a too small size. I imagine I wear these everyday towards to end of pregnancy, to/from home from the hospital etc.",5
"For all nursing moms, this is a must have. I don't know why I waited so long to get it. But let me tell you, it makes life so much easier! Trust me, you won't regret it. As for size, I'm a 36 D. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.",5
"I pump exclusively, since my bebe refuses to latch, and I finally caved in and bought this hands-free bra. For someone like me, who spends anywhere from 2-3 hours a day pumping, I feel like this is a must-have. It is excellent for sitting and working at the computer. The quality seems to be good, but I just started using it so I can't speak for the long term. I followed the sizing guide and purchased a medium, which has worked perfectly. (I was a 32 DD pre-pregnancy.) I could wish the pump slots were slightly farther apart, but it still works fine. The first time I used it I tried without a nursing bra underneath and I haven't attempted to do so again, due to the difficulty I experienced in safely removing everything without fear of spilling. I have gotten better at taking it off afterwards. I'd say that's the only trouble I've had with this purchase, and it's probably just me being a goon. This definitely makes for a better pumping experience--highly recommend!",5
"I don't know how I used to pump without this bra.  I can now pump and work at the same time or just read a magazine.  The bra itself is very comfortable and fits perfectly.  I would recommend it to anyone who pumps.",5
"Bought this because I couldn't figure out how to have five hands to hold the breast pump in place and help express my milk during pumping. This solved my problem. Can also multi-task while wearing. Good size based on chart. Definite recommend!!",5
"The bustier does what it claims. I wear a 36-38 C while nursing and the large is a good fit for me. It's comfortable but not too big. My hands are free while pumping.",5
"This is a great product and I recommend it to any new mom that is breastfeeding/pumping.",5
"This is a must have for pumping. It makes pumping a lot easier. I can see myself using this a lot in the future.",5
"i cant imagine pumping without this. allows you to be hands free, use laptop, eat, etc. it is good to have more than one so that you have a spare when one is in the wash.",5
"At first I wasn't sure about getting one of these. But I ended up pumping exclusively with my son and wanted someway to be able to multi task while pumping. Although this thing isn't perfect, it certainly does a good job for the price. It fits a little snug but I imagine it has to or it would slide off... it is just a tube top after all. Its comfortable enough for what it is but I will have to see how long it lasts.",5
"This is a must have if you double pump. I found it hard holding with my hands and turning pump on and off. Great quality. I ordered a size up just because I didnt want it to tight and cause restriction. I think regular size would have been fine also.",5
"Very effective and helpful in double pumping.    Good value for the money you spend. Can store in pumping bag and does not take up much room.",5
"[...]  Once I returned to work I used this bra (borrowed from a friend) and I can't imagine pumping without it!  I do not enjoy pumping at all, so being able to do it hands free allows time to pass much more quickly.  I am able to eat lunch, work on my computer, and even write this review as I pump!  My one issue is the zipper - sometimes when I zip it up the bottom comes apart.  Not a big deal, I just unzip it and try again.",5
"Such a simple idea but works so well. This changed my life as far as hands free pumping. The bra is sturdy and holds the pump parts yet is comfortable. The material is not made cheaply. It also seems to make pumping more comfortable.",5
"I knew this would be helpful but I couldn't imagine how much. Our baby ended up in the NICU for 4 weeks so I pumped using this every 3 hours for 4 weeks! It is still useful now that I'm at home and back to work and can get things done while I'm pumping!",5
"I am a 38D with my milk in full supply and I ordered a Large.  Had I been any bigger (and despite their size chart) this bustier would not have fit me.  I would recommend this product to any new mom planning to return to work & needing to pump...or just wanting 2 free hands!",5
"This item is great! It is the best hands free option. I would suggest buying the size that you were in pre-pregnancy. I would normally wear a medium in clothes and ordered this in a Large. Now that I am back to my normal size it is too big on me. It is kind of expensive for what it is though.",5
"I really like this product, but I had to return it the first time I ordered it because it did not fit me.  I am 34 A/B and S was too small for me, but M is just right.  I am probably lucky that the distance between my nipples is the same as the distance between the holes in the bra, but I suspect this will not be the case for everyone.  Overall, it is very functional.",5
"I was so excited to find this in my local Target! I exclusively pump, so I spend a lot of time pumping. Being able to feed and change baby, clip coupons, make grocery lists, read books, etc. while pumping makes my life SO much easier. Unfortunately, within a couple of weeks, the seam started to tear a little, so there is a superficial hole in the top of it. I really should have purchased the next size up. I'm currently a 40DD and purchased a large.It was the only one in the store, though, so I snatched it while I could. I highly suggest this product!",5
"Makes pumping life SO much easier. I would've stopped pumping long before without this bra.  Was 32B pre-baby, 34C post baby and ordered small.  A little tight at first but you want it tight because it will stretch out a bit and you need it tight in order to keep the pump suctioned and for it to stay up.",5
"Buster runs small so buy one size bigger than you think. Also if you can sew at all add a hook at the top so you don't break your zipper. A wonderful accessory. I highly recommend it!",5
"Makes pumping a lot easier. I only wore when pumping to have hands free. The zipper gets stuck but the amount that I use it that is to be expected. I bought several of these between 2 kids.",5
"I was very hesitant to buy at first. All the reviews I read were about broken zippers but I've had no issues. I had a five dollar off coupon that had come in the Madella breast pump that I bought. \",5
"I used this 3 times a day for a year - it was a life saver and held up through many washes and daily abuse. Never had issues with the zipper and found the item to be great quality. Don't know what I would've done without it!",5
"I absolutely LOVE this bustier! I didn't buy one/use one with my first child & pumping time and I don't know how I survived without it. This has made pumping at work so much easier for me. It fits easily under my clothes and allows me to continue working while pumping for my baby!",5
"I purchased this item for my daughter. She loved it as it has allowed her freedom to pump and also do other things at the same time.",5
"Ordered this for my girlfriend and she says it's a life saver!!",5
"I bought this because I was falling asleep while pumping. It works so awesome and I can do other things while pumping instead of doze off. Great Idea!",5
"Couldn't pump without this! Definitely need to purchase this if you plan on pumping!",5
"I pumped every 2 hrs while my son was in the NICU for almost a week and did not have this product, my husband just bought me this 2 weeks ago and now I have no clue how I did without it for so long! Seriously, it's worth the money!!!",5
"If you are serious about pumping and plan on doing it for a while I would recommend this. I did it for about 1 moth w/o this and pumping double was hard, unless my husband was there it start the pump for me. Now that I have this life is much easier on my own. It does fit smaller than a normal bar, so I would go up 1 size to be on the safe side.",5
"This bustier completely frees your hands so that you can do other things (like feed your child a bottle, answer the phone, check email) while you're pumping. The quality is good and it's easy to wash.  I plan to purchase one in black, as well.",5
"Love it!  It works great while freeing up your hands for other things!",5
"It completely does its job for being hands free. It also fits for plus size woman comfortably. The only thing I don't like is the wholes in the bra can be seem through your shirt so you have to wear another bra over. Works great for what I needed it for.",5
"This has got to be the greatest invention ever! I have used this 3 times so far and all 3 times have been great! I wear a 38C and the large fits perfect. I now feel like i have much more time whereas before I had to pump 1 breasted at a time because I could not hold both at the same time. I use mine with my lansinoh pump. I definately reccommend this to any mom that is pumping.",5
"I have both this belly band and the blanket from Belly Armor. I love them both, as the really do prevent radiation (I tried the cell phone test several times). I use the blanket all the time at home, and the band when I'm out, especially when traveling. I've also started buying them as gifts for my mommy-to-be friends.",5
"Very comfortable and if you have big bust it's still very roomy. I went from a DD to a F/G and the 3x is perfect. I'm going to get another one I work out in it and it's very supportive and if comfy enough to sleep it",5
"I have been searching for a sports bra forever and finally found one I enjoy. It is a nice fit but a bit snug. I think I just need to wear it a bit more beforehand. I wear a size 42DDD so I bought size 3x which is great. Just a little snug but haven't worn it much yet.",5
"LOVE these tank tops. They are the perfect undershirt for my growing belly. They are long enough they will cover a very large belly. They are stretchy and comfortable. I will be ordering these in every color. I wear one every day, so comfy! I highly recommend these. I think they will be perfect for after pregnancy too.",5
"These are perfect maternity tanks. I wear them under everything. They are super stretchy, the are long enough to cover a long bump, and they are super comfortable. I will buy them in every color. They are my new go-to under shirt. I think they will even be great after pregnancy. Can't recommend them enough!!",5
"I am so glad i discovered these tanks with my first pregnancy. not only did i wear them through third trimester, i wore them for nursing, and even after since i have a long torso a good long tank is hard to find. You wont be disappointed!",5
"Love the fact that this is LONG. Being a tall person and carrying low long shirts are better! Only thing I would probably like to see them change is the straps being adjustable...But thats ok I'm very please with this product",5
"Best maternity tank on the market!",5
"Love this shirt! Love the fit and its really comfortable. Super cute with a solid color scarf.",5
"The bra is a must for pumpers! It's made just right as long as you get the right size. I ordered the large first, which was way, way too big. As long as your bra size is smaller than 40 w/ any cup size, no matter how much expansion you have had due to milk, it will work well! The large is just too large for anyone w/ a size 36 or 38 no matter how large the breast itself. That's all folks.",5
"This is in my top 3 favorite baby-related items I bought.  SO nice to have hands free when pumping.  It makes the time go so much faster to be able to type, text, or multi-task.  Also nice when connecting and disconnecting from the pump to make less of a mess.\n\n\n\nI like this bra in particular because-\n\n1. It can be adjusted as your size changes.  I've been pumping for 8 months and have adjusted it multiple times as I've lost baby weight and it continues to fit well.  I was concerned that there are only two sizes, but between the zipper panel and the velcro in the back, it can cover a huge range of sizes.\n\n2.  Washes well.  I've washed multiple times and I accidentally dried it once with no issues.\n\n3.  Price was very good- comparable to other bras.\n\nAll in all, a VERY worthwhile purchase.  I would recommend it to anyone who is going to pump.",5
"This bustier is great! If you're pumping and don't want to sit there and hold the bottles for 20 mins, you need this. Does not cause leakage. Worked better than expected!",5
"I LOVE this bustier. I wish someone had told me about them sooner. I use it when I am getting ready in the morning. In the 10-15 mins it takes for me to brush my teeth, put on my make up and do my hair, I am able to pump at the same time. I actually do not dread having to pump and think it will work out well when I return to work. A much cheaper solution than the Medela hand's free pump. ;)I would recommend it to anyone who needs to pump",5
"Let's face it, pumping is a huge pain, no matter how motivated and determined you are to make it work. This bra makes a huge difference in comfort level and allowing you to relax a bit - use your computer, read a book, have a snack - whatever you choose to do while you're pumping. Fabric is soft and stretchy, nice quality. Yes, I believe others when they say it's easy to cut one out of a sports bra, but this is well worth the money in my opinion!",5
"I'm using the Medela pump and i love this bra, it is very convince for me. It gives me a lot of flexibility to check my emails or text. The velcro is super good! its very tight, which is good",5
"This bra works great--I am using it right now. I am so happy to not have to sit here and hold the shields while pumping.The fabric is soft and stretchy but snug and it comes with some other accessories I haven't used yet, but I am happy with it the way it is. Woo hoo!",5
"I bought this yesterday since i was only pumping 1 oz per breast. I was getting frustrated and tired. I hated holding the bottles in my hands. I bought the XS-L at the store but was worried about the fit since i am 40D. The adjustable velcro in the back makes it fit amazingly. Its snug enough to hold up the bottles, yet not squeezing me to death. This morning, i pumped 7oz in one sitting. Highly recommend!",5
"Love this bra. Changed my whole experience pumping milk. Has made pumping milk much, much more comfortable. You can work online and get things done with this bra. Its very well made, well designed, and easy to use. I can't say enough about it. You may be reluctant to spend almost $40 on yet another baby related purchase, but I assure you...this is a must have if your a pumping mother. No regrets!",5
"The Lansinoh arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I opened it and it is sooo much better! It has many options for size.  It has extensions and it  works so great I couldn't have designed one any better than this thing. I'm very pleased with my purchase and have no complaints at all. Lansinoh did a great job with this product.",5
"Whoever invented this deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.",5
"I wasn't sure I'd end up using this...like maybe it would be hassle. It is worth every penny, as it is quick and easy to put on and you can save time by doing all kinds of things with your hands while you're pumping...writing, typing, eating, using the TV remote... :)",5
"Absolutly love the Simple Wishes Hands Free Breast Pump Bustier!!! It is easy to use, comfortable and allows you to do other things while pumping. A must have for breastfeeding moms!!",5
"Buying this product is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Although I am blessed to have a workplace that is very supportive with me having to pump a few times a day, I was always very frustrated that I could not get much work done during those times because I was having to hold up the breast shields. This bra holds the shields securely in place and allows me to keep working while I pump. I couldn't ask for anything more! Such a great purchase!",5
"I am in love with this hands free pump bustier. I wish I had it for my first baby. Pumping before was always awkward. I would always hunch over the horns and I could never get anything done. What I love about this bustier is that you can adjust the size both with the velcro on the back and the zipper panel in the front. I am also able to assist the pumping with massage since I could make it as tight or as loose as I wanted it. The only downside I am able to see is the awkwardness of getting out of it, but that doesn't even compare to the awkwardness of not having it! This is fantastic and this is a total MUST for any pumping mom!",5
"This is the perfect bra for a working, typing, reading mother!!! This is the only bra I have ever bought and my child is a little over 6 months. I started using it when he was about 2 months. I take it to work everyday and use it twice a day 5 days a week. It stays in my Medella backpack. It holds the shields in place for true hands-free pumping. In fact, I am pumping as I am typing this review. I wash it in the washer and hang it up to dry. I only wear it when I am pumping though so I am not sure of its longevity if you wear it as a regular bra on some days. Thankfully, my job has a place I can pump in peace behind a closed door. I do like the fact that it has an adjustable back. I definitely have used it since I have lost about 15 pounds since giving birth (mostly due to exclusively breastfeeding). The only slight issue is that the zipper started to give a bit. I thought it was stripped at one point. But, it is still working. I am considering buying another one in a few more months. But, for the wear and tear and price, this one is holding up well, all things considered.",5
"I wear DDD pre-pregnancy and G while nursing. An XL / Large Plus fits great with room to spare. Material is soft and zipper is easy to use. Great high quality product. Use several times a day and love it!",5
"Just tried this product after reading reviews and I love it! I have the medela pump and this slips right into it. It is really comfortable fabric and it has a velcro piece in the back that is adjustable. It's really nice to not have to hold the pump.",5
"I've been using this bustier for two weeks now, and although I had to adjust to taking the time to put it on and get the pump's flanges perfectly in place before starting, I'm very happy with it now. It's totally worth the initial set-up time because I can wash bottles while I pump, read a book, etc. The bra is highly adjustable and will go much bigger or smaller, which is great because it ensures a very good fit. It's well made and stays put, and it holds up the bottles even when they're full, though I prefer to lean forward and rest them on the counter. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and am so glad I bought it despite our tight budget- this truly was an investment that is paying off!",5
"I bought this bra so I could pump while I typed on the computer.  Works great, I don't get the annoying marks on my arms trying to hold the cups up like I used to.  The bra keeps the cups up so I don't have to hold them at all.",5
"Love this one...easier to put on, better coverage, and better fit. Should have bought this one first!",5
"This fits wonderfully and stays in place. I was skeptical of a bra that was designed to fit women size xs-L but it does! I am xs and it uses strong Velcro to switch sizes. It helps to free up my arms so that I can care for my twins while pumping. Great quality too.",5
"I have only used the bustier a couple times so far, but it was easy to put on and use. Its much easier to pump now that my hands are free.",5
"I'm pumping exclusively to feed my daughter, and this has been a huge help! Its comfortable and allows me to be hands-free while pumping, which adds up to quite a lot of time during the day. I'd highly recommend this!",5
"I just returned to work 1 month ago, and our little guy is now 3 months old. I used to hate pumping with our first son, because I felt like I was wasting so much time at work. Now I welcome pumping as a time to catch up on paperwork or reading. I'm a pediatrician, and I recommend this to friends and patients. Of all of the fancy gear we've accumulated for our little ones, this is my favorite. Absolutely worth the price.",5
"I am currently wearing size 40F bras. I had my doubts about this bra since there were only two sizes to choose from, but it is perfect. There is a large strip of hook and loop fabric for the back and a strip of fabric to zip in front, making it easily possible to customize this bra. I can email and text and even put on makeup while pumping with this bra. I highly recommend this bra for any woman of any size!",5
"Nursing my fist child, I didn't have this, so pumping was such a chore & took a lot of time away from things.  At work, I ended up skipping a session here & there, of which I underestimated the consequences.  I was struggling by 5 months to keep nursing.  With my second child, I learned about this bustier at a pump class and it has made a HUGE difference.  I can pump much more often than I would have without it.  I travel with it, and actually have been able to pump (with a nursing shawl to cover me) at an airport terminal, on an airport shutltle van & actually on the airplane with someone next to me.  I am able to pump hands free and look at pictures of my baby, eat lunch, drive (although not recommended I'm sure), etc.  I've made so much use of my driving time because of this bustier.  I'd say that over 50% of my pumping sessions happen in the car.  It's totally adjustable, can wear over sweaters or just nursing bra.  The adjustability comes in handy when you lose your baby weight or go through seasons.  I can honestly say I have maintained my milk supply because of this bustier.  My 2nd child is 8.5 months old today and no sign of my milk supply diminishing!  I recommend this to everyone I know.  Get one! I couldn't stand pumping the first time around because I felt trapped.  This time around, it's tolerable; just a slight nuisance.  ;)",5
"This is such a great addition to the occasional or every-day pumping mama. I own the Medela Freestyle pump and the clips do not fit with any other bra, especially the bras I purchased. I am very large chested with a small band size and had to put the Medela bra on, strap on all the clips and hold very still, every time I wanted \",5
"LOVE THIS! It's very comfortable and works with Medela just fine. I also have the Medela Pumping Bra and this one is much more comfortable and has stayed up instead of sliding down. I really like how you can adjust the size of it as well! What a great feature!",5
"I am almost exclusively pumping for my newborn daughter, so I'm spending a lot of time pumping. After making lots of messes and getting frustrated trying to do other things while double pumping, I decided to spend the cash and try this out due to the good reviews. I love it! I was worried it might be too small since I am right on the line between a XS/S/M size and a L/XL size, but I am glad I got the smaller size. The extra panel that zips into the front makes it just the right size for my large chest and it holds the pumps firmly to my breasts without leaking. I'm very happy I spent the money - totally worth it.",5
"Love this product! I pump for my LO, and at times I will be pumping while eating, feeding my LO, and maybe on the phone, all at the same time! It used to take me between 30-60 mins to pump, because of this pumping bra, it takes me 15-30 mins tops! The bra is adjustable to your ribcage size, and is not a thick material, so I can still do what I need to do when I have a case of mastitis. Definitely recommend this product!",5
"This bra makes it so comfortable and easy to pump. Before I had this bra I didn't seem to get a lot of milk when I pumped but now that I can search on my phone or play with baby while pumping I seem to get a lot more where my mind is on something else and I am relaxed. Buy this bra if you want to make your life a little easier.",5
"Makes pumping so much easy ,this is a must have I love how I can feed my son or be on the phone while I pump !",5
"Hands free pumping? YES PLEASE!! Do more while you pump! With the hands free bra, I am able to wash all of the bottles and storage supplies while I pump! Become more efficient by maximizing your time!!!",5
"The first few weeks with a newborn are overwhelming, and it seems we can barely find time to do anything other than pump and breastfeed. With this bra I was able to do something so basic-EAT! It seems silly, but when you have a newborn multi-tasking is your best friend. I loved my bra and even got one for my sister in law. The bra is so well adjusted and ensures a secure fit so you don't lose and of that liquid god.",5
"I am a mother of 3 and am always multi-tasking. With this bra I am able to have both hands free to fold laundry and even eat dinner! It is extremely comfortable and fully adjustable! I recommend this hands-free pumping bra for nursing/pumping moms, no matter what size your bust!",5
"I used this when my son was a newborn. Super easy to use and a nice tool. Fits perfectly!",5
"I own two of these simple wishes hands free pumping bras! I love them and make pumping so much easier and convenient;. The bra is very comfortable too and can be adjusted to fit your body. I tried multiple brands before finding this one and am so glad I did. It has made pumping a breeze and makes my nighttime routine so much easier. I highly recommend this pumping bra to anyone! The bra is flexible, the material is so soft, it fits your breasts nicely the way the fabric fits the curves of the body, the bra is adjustable to your body time (all the other brands I tried did not), and it makes my life much easier when I'm pumping.",5
"its very easy to use!",5
"The bra makes pumping so much easier and if using a double pump a must have. Great product.",5
"I love this for ease during pumping. The few times I was without make you appreciate it more!",5
"This product gave me so much freedom (and still does)! I don't know how I ever lived without it!",5
"This hands-free pumping bra saved my life! Okay, a little dramatic, but it made my pumping experience so much better. I exclusively pumped and this gave me the chance to multi-task while hooked up to my pump 5 times a day. It was comfortable and held the shields securely in place. I would definitely recommend getting yourself a few if you're still nursing when you go back to work, or are exclusively pumping.",5
"This is the best hands free bra! It's tight and sturdy but also a large size so that it can fit ladies of of shapes and sizes. It is easy to put on too.",5
"I LOVE this product!!! This is one product that I use nearly everyday. Whether I pump at home or at work, it makes pumping so much easier. I knew from the 1st time I used it that it was worth every penny I paid for it. I wish I would have had it years ago when I started breastfeeding. Its easy to use, comfortable, very soft material, pretty color. Very pleased!!!",5
"Easy to use- a must have for moms going back to work and pumping. Very well made",5
"I just got this the last weekend and I love it. I got it in the light pink. It is easy to adjust to size and is comfy. Easy to put on and use. It helps get a great suction on my breasts and makes doing thing in the house so easy! Recommended for anyone that pumps!",5
"While using this, I'm able to get things done while pumping for my baby. It's comfortable and easy to use!",5
"I've tried 4 different pumping bras and this is the only one I like and keep going back to. It's adjustable which is great. And it's pretty discreet which is great when I have to pump in the car.",5
"As an exclusive pumping mom for both of my daughters this is a A life saver!!! I wouldn't have pumped for over a year with my first without and currently my 7 month old we are still going strong. I recommend this to everyone it had made life so much easier at home and work!! I'm pumping while writing this review!",5
"With having a two year old running around and a new baby this bra was a life saver. It's easy to put on and be able to pump without the hassle of holding the suction cups of the breast pump.",5
"Keeps the pumps in place, can move around room just no fast movemts. Does not lose its shape after washing either.",5
"I pumped for over a year after a surrogate pregnancy and donated to a milk bank for preemies. Let me just say - I could not have made it without this hands free bra! If you are going to pump AT ALL, I HIGHLY recommend this bra!! I cannot say enough good things about it.",5
"Very comfortable and practical item. Recommended",5
"I use this everyday to pump at work; fits great, comfy, and makes pumping so relaxing.",5
"This product is amazing. I have been using it almost everyday and it has been a lifesaver. I have a newborn, a one year old and a five year old so I need something that allows me to use my hands doing other things. I love how you can adjust the size of the bra to fit your exact size.",5
"I have twins and a 3 year old. before i got this i was constantly spilling milk because i was trying to do things to help my toddler while holding the pump with my forearms and it would drop and spill and was a disaster lol. this is a bit pricey but totally worth it. as a mom, having your hands free is completely priceless! i cannot imagine life without this anymore lol",5
"I tried several hands-free pumping bras and this one is my favorite! It adjusted to fit you, super easy to use, easily cleaned and comfortable!!!",5
"This is a great product and true to size. I pump at work and instead of needing to hold the pumps I am able to put on this bra and let the bra do all the holding while I relax or even have a chance to eat a snack. This has made pumping very easy.",5
"Love that you can use this product while checking email and working. Th bra allows you to pump and do other things at the same time. The best part of the bra is it stays up without the straps and is adjustable...as your weight shifts after giving birth, you can tighten the bra as needed (with velcro). Allows one bra to work the entire post pregnancy nursing. BEST PRODUCT & a time saver. I use it at work when I'm in a lactation room and continue working on my computer without having to hold any of the parts. I recommended to a couple co-workers and they are all very happy with how this bra has helped them be more efficient and spend less time at work making up for lost time while pumping.",5
"Ok so pumping is time consuming and can be boring. And as much as a mom pumps, it can take a lot of time away from you. I love this bra because it goes perfectly with my Lansinoh Signature Pro Double Electric Breast Pump! Its cute and I like the light pink color so it's feminine. It is actually pretty comfy too. I love the full frontal zipper which I think is totally awesome and makes it easy to use and put on and take off. It comes with straps that attach easily so you can wear it like a regular bra, as a racer back or cross strapped or halter or just as is as a strapless bra. I love this though because it makes pumping so much easier now that I dont have to hold the pump with my hands. It's easy to set up and you just insert the pump through the flaps, and they hold up really well and it works great. I have had no problems. It is like the epitome of fashionable and functional! Since using this, I can still do some of the things I need to like fold laundry, peel potatoes in front of the tv, give attention to my baby, etc! The fabric is really soft and comfy. It's kind of a stretchy material too. And it definitely makes it easier to pump since you don't have to hold them up yourself. I just wish I had one of these for when I was pumping for my other 2 children. I did receive this product for free as part of a product trial program but the experience and opinions are my own.",5
"The Simple Wishes hands free bra is a life saver. I am an exclusive pumper and have been pumping for almost 17 months. The first two month without the bra was so hard that I wanted to quit. When I got the hands free bra I was able to do things while I pumped like hold and feed my baby. It also reduced the movement of the flanges while I pump which eliminates the milk dripping out caused by my hand slipping and soaking my clothes.",5
"Absolutely love this product. It makes double pumping a breeze and so relaxing.",5
"I love this product! I am a mom of a 3 year old and an eight month old and I am an exclusive pumper and this product helps me be able to pump and to make sure that my toddler isn't getting into anything while I am busy. I hook up to the pump and am still able to walk around and do stuff. I wish I would of had this when I was pumping with my first, it would of helped our so much! One of the best things I have ever bought!",5
"After exclusively breastfeeding for 12 weeks, I had to go back to work. I ordered this hands free bra the first day back on the job, as it was so frustrating to not be able to move while pumping. I was worried about the fit, as I am a very plus sized woman. The bustier fits well, although don't think you are going to wear it all day. It is definitely a \",5
"After breastfeeding my daughter for 5 months I decided to break down and get a pumping bra. I hesitated because I only pump at night, it was just another thing to lug around and put on. What a mistake!! I don't know how but I pump so much more and efficiently than ever before. Plus my hands are free. Ladies, do yourself a favor and get this bra!",5
"I love this product. I use it daily!! The adjustable straps are amazing and easy to use.",5
"I have not returned to work yet, but this does help me tremendously! I would also like to think that using the bustier also helps get the most of my milk versus my holding it with my hands! Plus my arms don't get tired!",5
"I wish I would have purchased this sooner, but I had waited a week to figure out that it was needed! I am an exclusive pumper so this was worth the money. This bra allows you to truly be \",5
"Thick material, stays up well, completely adjustable with heavy-duty velcro. Comes with optional straps (I assume they are to be used if you wear this as your real bra). Wish it were cheaper but it seems average for pumping bras.",5
"I have a preemie so I'm pumping after every feeding and this bra has made it SO much better! Before I didn't have enough hands to even feel comfortable turning the dials on my pump, now I'm writing this review as I do it. Definitely worth the money!",5
"I bought this bustier yesterday after finding myself needing to pump both breasts in order to heal some sore nipples. It made what was going to be a very exhausting few days a little less exhausting. The bra is adjustable and I was able to find the perfect fit. It holds the flanges in place quite snugly, and allows me to use my hands to do other things to pass the time. I use it with my Medela pump, and it works beautifully. I highly recommend making the investment if you find yourself needing to pump for an extended amount of time.",5
"Easy to put on and can really pump hands free. Glad I purchased it. Can pump and do other things (like go on the computer and write a review!) at the same time. Runs on the small side though. I wear a Med/Large and I adjusted it to the widest possible fit.",5
"This has been super helpful. It makes life so much easier when you don't have to hold the bottles while you pump. I can use my time more wisely now while I pump.",5
"I haven't tried any other hands free systems, so cannot compare, but this has been most helpful as I pump. I'm a 32H bra size, thanks to my daughter, and this fits well and provides the support needed while pumping. It comes with an included halter strap, which I don't even need.",5
"This hands free bra made pumping much more comfortable for me. Holding the flanges against my chest was getting really old! I'm not getting up doing anything crazy while I pump, but it's nice to be able to drink some water, use the computer mouse or remote, or pat my baby while pumping. The bra is very snug around me right now but the zipper is quite sturdy and so is the velcro in the back. I have been using this item about twice/day for 2 weeks at home and everything is holding up so far. I take it on and off each time, so it adds a few minutes to the pumping procedure. If you have a small chest and pump frequently, you could probably wear it around as your bra under a thick structured and/or patterned shirt, but there are no cups - it is a flat compression style - so \",5
"I bought a different pumping bra, and it was ok, but this one is SO much better. More comfortable, adjustable, and feels like it's better quality. All you working breastfeeding mamas - get this one!",5
"This bra is made very well. It hold the flanges onto the breast great and allows for true hands free double pumping. I wear a size 44DDD (maybe a bit larger cup now because of the milk) and this bra works great. It doesn't offer underwire type support, but it holds the girls up enough to get the job done well.\nI recommend this bra to anyone pumping. Set up time for pumping takes a bit longer at first, especially if you have large breasts, but you get used to it quickly. The material is soft, the bra offers adjustability for size and comes with straps to help hold you up.\nIf there was any way to improve the bra, it would be that I'd love to be able to wear it while breastfeeding and be able to pump the other breast at the same time.",5
"This worked perfectly for me. It's fully adjustable in the back so you can get if fit exactly like you need it. Holds the flanges up snugly to my body so I can pump hands free.",5
"This bra is the best... Don't waste your time and money buying the other brand.... The quality, effectiveness, and flexibility this bra provides makes it the easy choice",5
"Great fit! Would really fit a wide range of sizes. Having the hands free is really nice.",5
"I love this bra, I hated pumping before I bought it but now its so much easier since I can multi-task.\nLove that it comes with straps and you can choose which side to wear it on. Also love the velcro back, adjustable to your personal size. And its really soft material which is great for when you're engorged.",5
"I tried another bra and this was one is FAR superior. My other bra eventually stretched out and there was no way to tighten it. This bra has a zipper in the front and velcro in the back in case you need to tighten it over time. I also LOVE the shoulder straps...just gives you the added support in case you produce a lot of milk ;) I HIGHLY recommend this breast pump bra. You won't be disappointed.",5
"Perfect for the multi-tasking pumper.",5
"My only regret is waiting until 6 months of pumping and nursing to buy this bra! So much more comfortable and easy to use.",5
"After trying ( and returning) the medela pump bra, I ordered the Lansinoh based on its great reviews. It's adjustable, the fabric is high quality, I use it several times a day. It's a bit expensive but worth it if you want your hands free while you pump.",5
"This makes my commitment of being a working mother that nurses so much easier. No complaints. Works perfectly!",5
"This product does wonders , so happy I ordered it!",5
"I have used this bustier every day since I got it! It's supportive and you really can go hands free. Great for the mommy of two!",5
"Great product, I'm a 40DD",5
"This bra is made really well. I love how you can really work it to fit your size. I am a pre-pregnancy 34C, and an EE while breastfeeding. They have made this bra very easy to adjust and I love that. You do want it to fit pretty tight so that it holds the shields and bottles in place. I have had zero problems with this bra, and find that it is a lot easier than holding both bottles in place, even if I'm not multitasking! Would definitely recommend for any nursing mom.",5
"By far the best one. It fits best, is adjustable, and holds the pumps in place perfectly!",5
"Easy to use and comfortable.  Has made pumping so much easier.  In my opinion, a must have if planning to pump on a regular basis.",5
"I came across this bra with my second baby and I can honestly say this is the best purchase I've made!!  It has allowed me to keep up with pumping every three hours, while caring for both my 3 month old and 2 year old. It's so easy to strap on and I can go about my daily life (within reach of an outlet).  I pump while eating with my family, changing diapers, using the computer, and just playing with my kids. I even pump driving down the road with my nursing cover on. I HIGHLY recommend this item!!!",5
"Second time mom and wished I had ordered this previously with my first child. I exclusively pump and it makes it so much easier. Definitely a must!! Love the adjustable bands and the options to add straps if desired.",5
"Have used this a few times and its great to be able to have full use of my hands while pumping. I like to compress and massage to get the most milk out and I can do that with this bra. A little pricey but they all seem to be about the same amount",5
"I love this product!  I pump at least 4 times a day for 20 minutes.  I was getting tired of sitting in an uncomfortable position holding the pump parts.  This bra works really well-it is comfortable and it holds the pump pieces in place.  Now I can  work on the computer or read a book!  LOVE IT!",5
"I read the reviews before purchasing and they were correct! I recommend everyone that is pumping gets one. One reviewer said that if you are between sizes to go with the smaller one. That was my situation however it was a close fit. I have to use the extender in the front and I have it on the last of the velcro on the back. I did not try the next size up however so I don't know if that would have been too big or not. Overall great product!",5
"[...] I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality! Soft fabric, well made and very adjustable. This will make pumping so much easier for people!",5
"Love it! I bought 2 pumping bras to compare. Right out the box, I decided to keep this one and return the medela one. This one has shoulder straps, strong adjustable velcro and an extender piece. Lots of options to create the perfect fit! Soft pink material is very comfy. Definitely worth the cost for comfort and hands-free freedom!",5
"I did a lot of shopping around for the best price and highest rated bra for pumping. This had great reviews but I was worried about the one size fits all. This bra has been perfect. Very comfy and easy to use. The zipper is high quality unlike others. Allows for good suction for pumping.",5
"Fits great\nEasy to adjust",5
"Works great! Ordered the L/XL/XXL. There are many ways to adjust it for the right fit. Gets the job done hands free. Very convenient. Great invention!",5
"I just used this for the 1st time at work and it makes pumping at work so much more comfortable. I was actually able to enjoy my pump break with reading a few pages in a great book. I haven't had time to read a book for fun in FOREVER. This product is true to size (as I am on the cusp of small and large, but ordered the small like the chart said) and very comfortable. I am going to recommend this to EVERYONE i know who is pumping!!!",5
"I am a first time mother, so I was new to pumping. I took a gamble and purchased this product after someone told me their sister uses it. I am thrilled! I no longer feel a slave to pumping. I am actually pumping both breasts while writing this review. Make your life easier and get the bustier!",5
"While this bra may not be the most attractive in appearance, it more than makes up for it in function. The openings in the cups provide great support for your breast pump flanges. The adjustable velcro back ensures great comfort and fit, even as your body changes back to it's pre-pregnancy state. Best of all, your hands are free to tackle other tasks while pumping! A true asset to all multi-tasking women!",5
"These were thick (but not hot) great quality leggings with a super comfy belly panel. I'm usually a S; I bought a S and have plenty of room to grow. Definitely no need to size up - maybe even a tad large. Also, I'm a long-legged 5'5\",5
"I'm about 20 weeks pregnant and I got these leggings. They are super comfortable. I think there will be plenty of room for me to \",5
"These leggings are the best! They are not sheer at all and still very breathable. They are VERY soft. I find a lot of the panels on maternity pants to be itchy...these are not itchy at all. I could live in these leggings! :)",5
"I love these pants, they are so comfortable. I wish they had different colors, I want to wear them everyday.",5
"Just got these and I love them. They are thicker than tights but not quite as thick as a solid cotton pant. There are no weird, pany-hose like seams on the thighs, so if your shirt isn't full tunic length, you will still be okay! The belly panel is comfy, and the length is perfect - I am 5'6 and they gather just a SMIDGE at my ankles, which I like because it makes them look little more like slim fit trousers than just leggings. If you are short though, you may not like this. The only possible problem I see is that because they do have that tights-like stretch to them, they may not hold up in the knees for very long. This may not be a problem for most, but I have an active 2 year old who I play with a lot on the floor, crawling around and whatnot, so these may not stand the test of toddler time :) But, we'll see.",5
"Bought these at 26 weeks and have been wearing for the past 1.5 months. They are the MOST comfortable article of clothing I own at the moment. Have held up well, and I plan to wear them through the rest of the pregnancy. I am 5'7\",5
"I wear a 38C usually and the XL fits perfectly. So comfortable you can sleep in it!!",5
"I wear a 38C usually and the XL fits perfectly. So comfortable you can sleep in it!!",5
"This bra is comfortable and practical! I wear it everyday with everything, so I bought another one exactly like it. The cups have the perfect amount of padding for comfort. When you unhook the cup to nurse, there is only a strap left instead of a triangle of fabric like most other nursing bras, so it doesn't get in the way like my other nursing bras do. I have a big rib cage (I wear a size large tshirt or size 12-14 dress) and smaller B cup breasts and size XL fits me perfectly.",5
"The only thing I don't love about this bra is the price. I do think it's worth it though as a new nursing mama and someone well endowed who's been struggling through the pains of learning to nurse.",5

"I tried, at least, 5 different/brands of nursing tanks...ranging from this price and higher...this Gilligan O'Malley tank isy ultimate fave.\nSoft fabric and fits well w. my clothes.\n\nNote : I, also, wear a nursing bra.",5
"Great product!!!  I have one in every color.  They could use a little more support for the girls but other than that no complaints.  Makes it easy to feed my son when traveling.",5
"Great through and through. Reviewed the white cami, same product just different colour.\n\nOnce wearing it, the colour seems to stretch in this particular cami.",5
"I love these nursing camis. I first received one as a gift and fell in love. I own 5 now hoping to buy the last two colors soon. You can dress them up or down and it makes nursing in public easier for you and baby also more accessible",5
"The second day of wearing the belly bandit, I saw results. My husband was amazed at how fast my belly has shrunken. I'm so happy i bought this.",5
"I bought the original belly bandit before I delivered my son. I have been wearing the medium for a week and I have already lost so much of my belly! I'm going to order the small because the medium is almost too big now and it barely fit right after I gave birth. I only wear it during the day but I find it to be very comfortable. I just wear one of my pregnancy be bands from target under it and it's great! It makes my back feel so much better too when I'm wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone for post pregnancy!",5
"Have been wearing a Large for a week and have already seen a difference. Will be purchasing a smaller size to keep up the momentum. Have received comments that I don't look like I had a baby a week ago. So happy I purchased!",5
"I purchased my bandit 5 weeks pp, unfortunately I had been using a girdle with no results previously. Within 2 weeks I have already lost 4 inches from my waistline! I wish I would have had it sooner!",5
"I bought this at 4 days post-partum bc I wanted to be sure of my measurements before \",5
"I purchased my belly bandit original a week prior to my second c section. Going in on the day I had my daughter I had weighed 180 and one month after birth I weighed 148. I put the belly bandit on right after I gave birth (3 hrs or so after.) And it also helped me with breastfeeding support too. It's just all around amazing. I have recommend this to many mothers!",5
"I have bought this twice now. And each time it has done wonders for my recovery after a C-section.",5
"I waited until a couple weeks after my son was born via c-section to start wearing a belly bandit. I wish I would have worn one sooner. It really helped to shrink my uterus and to provide some much needed support after a c-section that I was not prepared for. We are trying to conceive and I will have a new belly bandit on hand before I deliver another child!",5
"I bought this with my first (after a painful first few weeks) and all I can say is I wish I would have had it from the beginning!",5
"I had a C section on 9/28 and started wearing the band on 10/1. Prior to putting it on, I couldn't climb in bed because it was too high, and getting up off the couch was difficult. Once I put it on, however, I was mobile again! It made me feel so secure and helped with the aches and pains. Plus, it's helping me shrink back down. Bonus! Love love love this product.",5
"I was pregnant with twins, and gained 40 pounds only in my belly. After birth, my abdominal muscles and back muscles were so weak, and I still looked pregnant. I wore the size medium for less than a week, then needed the small. Within days I could Velcro the small to its tightest levels and that provided the support I needed to flatten my tummy and provide back support. I enjoy wearing it and it gives an extra level of confidence. I also have the belly shield, but I prefer to wear th bandit over a fitted tank under my shirt. I'm back to a size 4 only two weeks after twins, and at my pre-pregnancy weight and feel like I look pretty good! :)",5
"It is comfortable to wear and cant see it under clothes. This is my 2nd c section and it has made a huge difference helping my tummy go down. I wish I would've bought one with my first baby! The only complaint I would have would be wishing that the length of the belly bandit was longer and covered my whole torso and not just the bottom part but overall great product and worth the money!",5
"I have only been using this for a couple weeks but can already tell a difference (compared to my last delivery where I didnt use anything after). I do wear it day and night. I was concerned it wouldnt be comfortable but it really is. I put it on the day after deliver and it helped my abdominal area feel less achy because the BB is squishing it all back in place :)",5
"I had a great experience with the belly bandit! I was given another stretchy wrap around support after my c-section and I definitely preferred the belly bandit! You can see both under clothes, but you just had a baby! Give your self some slack :) I liked the belly bandit more than the other one because it gave incredible back support! I will definitely try this again with our next pregnancy!",5
"I bought this product right before delivery because I wanted to have it at hand! This is by far the best product I've ever used for my tummy. I will let my before n after photos do the talking. I will recommend this product to all my pregnant friend for postpartum recovery success!",5
"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5
"This single-handedly got me back to my pre-baby weight in less than 6-months! Thank Gawd for the Belly Bandit",5
"I've bought several of these for friends. They absolutely love them and the results.",5
"This is the best - definitely helped with my post baby body. And also felt comfortable and supportive.",5
"The second day of wearing the belly bandit, I saw results. My husband was amazed at how fast my belly has shrunken. I'm so happy i bought this.",5

I just wear one of my pregnancy be bands from target under it and it's great! It makes my back feel so much better too when I'm wearing it. I would recommend this to anyone for post pregnancy!",5
"Have been wearing a Large for a week and have already seen a difference. Will be purchasing a smaller size to keep up the momentum. Have received comments that I don't look like I had a baby a week ago. So happy I purchased!",5
"I purchased my bandit 5 weeks pp, unfortunately I had been using a girdle with no results previously. Within 2 weeks I have already lost 4 inches from my waistline! I wish I would have had it sooner!",5
"I bought this at 4 days post-partum bc I wanted to be sure of my measurements before \",5
"I purchased my belly bandit original a week prior to my second c section. Going in on the day I had my daughter I had weighed 180 and one month after birth I weighed 148. I put the belly bandit on right after I gave birth (3 hrs or so after.) And it also helped me with breastfeeding support too. It's just all around amazing. I have recommend this to many mothers!",5
"I have bought this twice now. And each time it has done wonders for my recovery after a C-section.",5
"I waited until a couple weeks after my son was born via c-section to start wearing a belly bandit. I wish I would have worn one sooner. It really helped to shrink my uterus and to provide some much needed support after a c-section that I was not prepared for. We are trying to conceive and I will have a new belly bandit on hand before I deliver another child!",5
"I bought this with my first (after a painful first few weeks) and all I can say is I wish I would have had it from the beginning!",5
"I had a C section on 9/28 and started wearing the band on 10/1. Prior to putting it on, I couldn't climb in bed because it was too high, and getting up off the couch was difficult. Once I put it on, however, I was mobile again! It made me feel so secure and helped with the aches and pains. Plus, it's helping me shrink back down. Bonus! Love love love this product.",5
"I was pregnant with twins, and gained 40 pounds only in my belly. After birth, my abdominal muscles and back muscles were so weak, and I still looked pregnant. I wore the size medium for less than a week, then needed the small. Within days I could Velcro the small to its tightest levels and that provided the support I needed to flatten my tummy and provide back support. I enjoy wearing it and it gives an extra level of confidence. I also have the belly shield, but I prefer to wear th bandit over a fitted tank under my shirt. I'm back to a size 4 only two weeks after twins, and at my pre-pregnancy weight and feel like I look pretty good! :)",5
"It is comfortable to wear and cant see it under clothes. This is my 2nd c section and it has made a huge difference helping my tummy go down. I wish I would've bought one with my first baby! The only complaint I would have would be wishing that the length of the belly bandit was longer and covered my whole torso and not just the bottom part but overall great product and worth the money!",5
"I have only been using this for a couple weeks but can already tell a difference (compared to my last delivery where I didnt use anything after). I do wear it day and night. I was concerned it wouldnt be comfortable but it really is. I put it on the day after deliver and it helped my abdominal area feel less achy because the BB is squishing it all back in place :)",5
"I had a great experience with the belly bandit! I was given another stretchy wrap around support after my c-section and I definitely preferred the belly bandit! You can see both under clothes, but you just had a baby! Give your self some slack :) I liked the belly bandit more than the other one because it gave incredible back support! I will definitely try this again with our next pregnancy!",5
"I bought this product right before delivery because I wanted to have it at hand! This is by far the best product I've ever used for my tummy. I will let my before n after photos do the talking. I will recommend this product to all my pregnant friend for postpartum recovery success!",5
"WOW what can i say but thank you thank you thank you .. my belly bandit has given me back my confidence . after having my son via c-section i thought my belly would never be the same.. boy was I wrong.. with the belly bandit i can say it is better than what i started with. it has helped me create a waist and has made me feel beautiful all while being very comfortable to wear.. Thank you !!",5
"I ended up having a c-section with my daughter and was so glad I bought this product! It made me feel so much more comfortable and literally felt like it was holding me together! The results are amazing and I credit it with helping my stomach area shrink back towards it's pre pregnancy shape! It's nude color is great and undetectable under clothes and love how breathable it was during the summer months! I LOVE it so much I plan on getting another one for baby #2 in December!",5
"So I swear by this product! I have used it twice now for two different pregnancies and have had amazing results both times! I wore it for 8 weeks both times, both day and night! Below are two photos, one at 36 weeks preggo and the other at 8 weeks postpartum. Love this product!",5
"This single-handedly got me back to my pre-baby weight in less than 6-months! Thank Gawd for the Belly Bandit",5
"I've bought several of these for friends. They absolutely love them and the results.",5
"This is the best - definitely helped with my post baby body. And also felt comfortable and supportive.",5
"I recently ordered upside belly being 33 weeks pregnant and starting to have extreme low back pain which is making everything more challenging. I am 5ft6 and 135 lbs now and was a size 2 prior to pregnacy and found that the size small fit well. Product seems to be made of good quality material but only had a day so far. Ice pack spot is awesome as that is exactly where I need it! Also purchased the full belly leggings in a size s and they are super comfy so far. Very pleased with my purchases and thought the service was easy and fast!!",5
"I have been wearing for a few weeks and can't believe how good the Upsie is! I went one day without it and couldn't believe how much I missed the added support for my growing belly. Keeps the little one off my bladder a bit as well which is really helpful. I am 5'4\",5
"I started having horrible lower back pain around month 6-7 during this pregnancy. I wasn't able to go grocery shopping without being almost crippled and walking like a penguin from hurting so bad. I purchased my band earlier this month, and fell in love! Whenever I have back pain or will be in a situation where I know I will end up with back pain, I put this baby on! It relieves the pain I already have and completely prevents the pain I would usually get.\nWay worth every penny! I tried on at least 10 other brands and this was the most comfortable and showed the least under my clothes:)",5
"The Upsie Belly is the best gifts I've ever received! I'm a petite person and by around 25 weeks, the back pains were becoming more difficult to ignore. Add to that sciatica and soon enough even walking around hurt, every step sent pain from the top of my left hip down to my knee. A friend have me the Upsie Belly and I swear I felt the relief almost immediately. It fit so well under my belly and covered the right amount of my lower back. Having the slight lift of my belly took off so much pressure. The material is soft and didn't irritate my skin the way I've heard some women complain about other brands and it didn't shift around either. I work as a medical assistant so I'm constantly on the move and sitting and getting up, so that was very important for me.",5
"This worked very well with helping to support my belly & back during my pregnancy. The ice pack was great to just to help with the aching back. I used it mostly while working 12 hour shifts but toward the end of my pregnancy I wore it most of the time.",5
"I bought this when I was 22wks pregnant with my second. It is seriously a life saver! My belly and back were so sore after being out and being on my feet for even just an hour. My upsie belly definitely relieved so much of the pressure and made this pregnancy so much better. I recommend it to every pregnant woman who experiences the same discomfort. Totally worth every penny!",5
"I was starting to get back pain due to the big heavy belly...this belt works fabulously. It eases the weight on your back and hips significantly and relieved my pain. Highly recommend it. It's also easy to wash (I wore it during the very hot summer and hand washed it regularly)",5
"I've had terrible back and hip problems with this pregnancy so bad that I had to go to the physical therapy. I put this one and it was immediate relief. I don't have to go to my therapist anymore. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone with back and hip problems!",5
"I purchased this at about 20 weeks hoping it would help relieve the pressure on my legs and veins. I am now at 36 weeks and wear this all the time and I love it!! It has really helped with my comfort and even though my veins are still bad it definitely helps take the pressure off my legs and has prevented back pain. I exercise daily and the upsie belly is great to support my tummy and keep me comfortable. I feel so much better when I wear this and even though it is a bit pricey it has been worth the investment and has held up extremely well.",5
"My mom bought me this after weeks of hearing me complain about back pain while pregnant with my daughter and I love it! It is the most helpful product I've had my entire pregnancy!!",5
"I started having back pain at about 26 weeks and the Upsie Belly has helped a ton! I think it will be very helpful after my c-section, too.",5

"Great tank - fit is good and style is great! Nice and long and has a good stretch to it! Use it for running, walking and in general is comfortable to wear all day. I purchased it in the green and also black (black seems to run smaller & is shorter). Fit is good and I am sure it will be great throughout my whole pregnancy - currently 6 months and fits nice - with room to grow!",5
"I love this tank, very comfortable (even for longer 5 mile runs)! The quality is outstanding. Worth every penny!",5
"I just had my 3rd child and desperately needed new nursing bras. After searching for nearly a month I came across this sleep bra online. I wasn't sure if the fit would work or not but I still ordered one in black and one in the dark red. Once I recieved them I tried it on and absolutely love the fit. There's not much support but I wasn't looking for that - I wanted a good sleep bra or bra to wear around the house. The lacy, almost see through material makes me feel a little sexier too compared to other sleep bras I've had or seen. Overall I highly recommend this bra - great fit, looks great & feels great.\nFor reference I'm a 38D.",5
"I bought these pants in store and I love them. I am 5'1\",5
"I love these pants. They are super soft and plenty thick, unlike many other leggings I've tried. The small fit great. I'm normally a 4-6 pre-pregnancy and about 5'7\",5
"I really like how the material is heavier than most spandex leggings. It doesn't show every single bump & lump and will provide a little more warmth. The material is 76% polyester, 20% rayon, and 4% spandex. I'm 22 weeks, 129lbs, 5'5\",5
"I am 24 weeks pregnant and was about to offer up my firstborn child for some maternity leggings that are not see-through. I have tried high-end brands at $50+ a pop, middle-of-the-road, and cheapies. I've tried at least 15-20 pairs of leggings or capri leggings in the past two months and absolutely everything is see-through! I was at my wit's end - why can't someone make maternity leggings that are opaque!? I thought for sure, for the price, these would be sheer at least in the rear, but they are absolutely perfect! The fabric is sturdy but not too thick, there is ample room in the belly (they're actually a bit too big on me now, but I am sure I will \",5
"I'm 7 weeks and my jeans are getting tight already. I found these today and thought I'd give them a shot. THEY. ARE. AMAZING. I'm a sz 22, and the XXL fits like a dream.",5
"A friend let me borrow these when I was pregnant, and they were by far my favorite leggings, but seemed to be always out of stock. I kept watching my local store and online for them to be restocked, and ordered 2 pairs once they became available.\nGreat length for my long legs, thick enough to wear in public as actual pants, and super comfortable. I was 140 lbs / 5'8\",5
"I really like these- Just bought them today! No complaints, just really happy with this pair!",5
"These leggings are amazing! They are so comfortable, dark, and feel expensive. I am definitely keeping them post-baby. They are thick enough to where you can't see panty-lines or anything like that, but I would still recommend wearing a tunic or top that covers your buttocks if you are a curvy girl like me. They fit me a bit long but I am 5'1 so that is to be expected. It doesn't matter though since they are leggings, they should fit any height pretty well.",5
"I love these leggings, mainly because of the thickness. You absolutely cannot see any underwear- they are not seethrough at all. It's nice not to have to stress about my shirt completely covering the back of my butt. They are nice and thick and soft. Great quality.",5
"I'm not pregnant. I buy maternity clothes because I have a large waist and small hips. I can wear a smaller size in maternity pants than regular pants. These are incredibly comfortable for anyone. I wear an over- blouse or t-shirt with them.",5
"Super soft and comfortable. Highly recommend for 1st and 2nd trimester. (I am only 22 weeks into my first pregnancy so I cannot yet speak to the 3rd trimester!)",5
"Good, thick, quality material! Very comfortable during pregnancy and post pregnancy! Awesome price!",5
"Fit great, super cozy & warm, not too tight around the ankles and long without being way too long...Im 5'6\",5
"Nice and thick comfy leggings!  Keep you warm too!",5
"Best leggings ever! Keeping these well after babies! Bought online just thinking they would be normal leggings but gladly wrong. Thicker and softer and waistband feels good. Ordering me some more right now!",5
"I highly recommend these to anyone searching for leggings that are not a cheap thin material! I prefer cotton leggings anyway over that leotard type material and these fit the bill perfectly. What I like most is that they make me feel \",5
"Bought these because I love stretchy pants when pregnant. They are super comfy and do not push in at my waistline like a lot of other under the belly pants I've tried do. They are long enough for me but I am tall so that may be an issue for shorter legs. I just wish they had these in other colors because I would have them all!",5
"I got these in the mail today and It is LOVE! They are great, super comfy, and not shear! I love that they are under belly, its one less hot layer on my already hot tummy. They seem a little long but I am 5'4\",5
"These are nice, basic cotton leggings. Thick enough that you can't see through them and nice and long so they can be tucked nicely into a pair of boots. I like the low-cut elastic band since I can wear these earlier in my pregnancy and not have to fold down a full panel (which from my past pregnancy was a total pain even when full term).",5
"I am obsessed with these crop pants for working out while pregnant!! I love that the back is lower than the tummy panel in front-my back avoids getting extra sweaty. Super comfortable and breathable fabric.",5
"Great pants for running. I bought two pairs because I like them so much.",5
"I'm on my 6th pregnancy and just discovered these. They are wonderful. I wear them at least four days a week. Can't imagine going through this pregnancy without them. I wore them from 3 months pregnant and am still wearing them at 33 weeks. They're still super comfy. As far as sizing, I'm 5' 9\",5
"These are great. I'm 23 weeks and there's no chance of them slipping when I jog. I've worn them several times since they arrived a few weeks ago and I anticipate them being a staple to my summer wardrobe (running errands, lounging around). I did order one size up and the fit was great.",5

"very comfortable for night and day wear. I think it provides good support without cutting in to my shoulders",5
"I love my nursing bra. I purchased this bra with my first pregnancy and it is going strong with my second child. Easy to access clips. Moveable and flexible material that allows any woman to wear, regardless of her size. I wore this bra into delivery of my second child and it felt like I was wearing nothing. It is both supportive and non intrusive when it needs to be.",5
"I decided to buy an Ameda nursing bra after trying serval other brands from motherhood maternity stores. Best decision ever!! The fit was perfect & it is very comfortable! After 4 months, it is still just like the 1st day I bought it! These are made for comfort & made to last!! Will never buy any other brand again!",5
"Very comfy! Easy to use! Nice for sleeping & easy to wash!",5
"I picked these up in-store today.  I don't know why online they aren't just called \",5
"I live in Chicago and wanted a thick legging to wear for the winter. This is perfect, almost as thick as a pant but still the look of leggings. I got the small and am 5'4 so they are a bit long, and the belly panel is loose for me at 20wks. I use the Bumped Cami to help keep them tight and have gotten so many compliments on them. Only have washed a few times so not sure how well they will hold up. Have been turning them inside out so hopefully they wont pill like other reviewers have mentioned.",5
"Every pregnant woman should have a pair of these. In fact, they should come in five different colors. They are so comfortable that once you wear them, you'll realize there is NO point to wearing uncomfortable khaki pants as a pregnant lady.",5
"These are great pants, especially for the price. They are a nice thick legging, so they're warm for winter and not see through at all. I ordered a small and they're a little big for me (for reference, I'm 27 weeks pregnant, 5'4\",5
"These are great! I just bought them today and they are super comfy!! I usually don't wear leggings but I like these enough to wear them :)",5
"These pants are wonderful.  I'm 24 weeks and finally decided to break down and buy a pair of pants as my pre-pregnancy ones are too uncomfortable now.  It's a huge difference! I wish I would have bought them sooner! I like my pants to fit a little tight, I am 5'3'' and usually wear a 4/6 before pregnancy. I had to get an XS in these and I'm glad I did.  They tend to slip down a little throughout the day.",5
"Perhaps Liz Lange updated these pants since the last reviewers tried them, but these are by far the greatest maternity pants I've had. They're extremely comfortable and look great dressed up or dressed down. They do pill a little bit, but I think in my case it's from such constant washing and wearing, so that's to be expected. I'm usually a small-medium pre-pregnancy, and I bought these pants in a small. I would recommend sizing down (I may try an XS for a second pair) because the band tends to loosen a bit and will slide down somewhat easily. Other than that, these are the greatest maternity pants!",5
"Like wearing sweat pants to work! Very comfortable, great for the later stages of pregnancy.",5
"I can't say enough good things about these leggings! They fit great, they are super comfortable, are good quality, and they don't fall down!! Couldn't be happier--highly recommend.",5
"This is the best nursing bra ever! It has the right amount of coverage, holds things in place nicely. It was my absolute favorite, and i had purchased 6!!!",5
"Fits perfectly and feels very comfortable. I love that it is easy to open.",5
"I am a 40DDD and have tried many different nursing bras and this is the best! It is super comfortable! It holds everything in, like a sports bra, so if you are looking for more of a lift this isn't the one, but for comfort and firm support you'll love it!!",5
"most comfortable nursing bra I've tried so far. I was severely engorged during my 1st week postpartum and this bra was a God send. The material is so soft and stretchy. I'm currently a 38DD and have trouble finding comfortable supportive nursing bras, this one is true to size and surprisingly supportive.",5
"I'm normally a 38 DD and I went with the XL. I am currently 37 weeks pregnant and everything I read about this bra is true. Not the most supportive but comfortable, true to size, and perfect for lounging around the house feeding a baby while recovering from a c section which is what I will be doing! I highly recommend this bra!",5
"I had a nursing bra from my last baby and it was falling apart because it was my \",5
"40DD and this bra in XL was perfect. Had to return others to get this one in another color--wish there were more color choices! Nice support, comfortable material and easy operation of access panels. This is THE bra to get, especially for large busts!",5
"This nursing bra is more comfortable than the sleep nursing bras I ordered. Not really enough support or \",5
"Didn't think I needed a nursing bra (thought I was special for some reason). Its super comfortable and highly recommend it!",5
"As heavy chested woman I was skeptical about how this bra would fit, but being 8 months pregnant you go more for comfort than looks. It fits perfectly and I am now comfortable to go about my day without the discomfort of normal bras.",5
"I love this bra. I currently have five and between nursing two children (one for 15m and one for 11m now) I have worn out five. Eventually the clasps in the back come apart on all the bras, but other than that I don't have any complaints.\nThe bra is the most comfortable I've found for nursing and pumping. I've tried multiple styles and brands. I've purchased from target, soma, and motherhood maternity and these are the best.its comfy enough to wear day and night.\nI have size large and I'm a 36 DDD. They stretch out a bit and need to be washed to tighten back up.",5
"I wore this starting at 20 weeks to make sure I was covered during that time when your regular clothes start getting too small and maternity clothes are still too big. Towards the end of my pregnancy it had just enough compression to help \",5
"I wore this pretty much the entire time i was pregnant and I think it saved me!\nA great support and made all of my clothes fit so much better.",5
"I own 7 of these Tanks in Black I love them. I weigh 245lbs and I am not pregnant but I love the fit of these.Perfect!",5
"When using a hip bandit place the belly shield low enough to cover your incision.\nWorks well to keep excess skin in place when putting on a belly bandit.\nExcellent for reminding you to keep better posture without causing discomfort.",5
"I'm happy I bought this to wear under my Belly bandit! Definitely made it more comfortable.",5
"I bought this after finding out I had to have a c-section with my twin girls. I gained 70 pounds and already lost 50 in the two weeks my girls have been born. Not to mention I have been able to up and moving the same day I had my c-section! I recommend this product to anyone who wants help recovering and wants to lose their baby weight as quick as possible.",5
"Most of the bad reviews are calling this a belly bandit with poor compression. This goes under the bandit so you can use lotions without getting your bandit dirty. The belly shield does just that although I did find that it slightly yellowed the inside of my belly bandit. Great product to help keep your belly bandit on your belly where it should be.",5
"I bought this to go along with my bandit and I really liked it. It did contain the mess of oils and lotions that I used on my belly. I plan on still using the product with other clothes while moisturizing my stomach and hips. A little pricey, but I am happy I got it.",5

"I bought this after finding out I had to have a c-section with my twin girls. I gained 70 pounds and already lost 50 in the two weeks my girls have been born. Not to mention I have been able to up and moving the same day I had my c-section! I recommend this product to anyone who wants help recovering and wants to lose their baby weight as quick as possible.",5
"Most of the bad reviews are calling this a belly bandit with poor compression. This goes under the bandit so you can use lotions without getting your bandit dirty. The belly shield does just that although I did find that it slightly yellowed the inside of my belly bandit. Great product to help keep your belly bandit on your belly where it should be.",5
"I bought this to go along with my bandit and I really liked it. It did contain the mess of oils and lotions that I used on my belly. I plan on still using the product with other clothes while moisturizing my stomach and hips. A little pricey, but I am happy I got it.",5
"Extremely Soft!!!! Fits loosely on a 38C/D frame. Over all great buy, now just waiting for cooler weather to wear it.",5
"runs a little small, but it's cute!",5
"Love this dress, covers well and is very ladylike. The tie belt has two gold accents that set it off beautifully.",5
"Love the bright colors, the scuba fabric is flattering. Fit is perfect!",5
"The dread of finding something to wear to the Christmas party is over. This dress is classic and sexy. I'm not dreading the party this year- hoping to find another time to wear this dress. It is the perfect little black dress- with some sparkle! Looking forward to shining this year instead of just covering up all in black. Pairing with black tights and shrug to complete the look!",5
"This dress is such a nice quality! It looks much more expensive than it is. I wore this the other day and received so many comments.",5
"The look, the fabric, the drape, the fit are all fantastic on this dress.",5
"This dress was just the right touch of easy and cool elegance for a casual holiday party. But I don't think it's limited to \",5
"Lightweight, doesn't wrinkle, fits perfectly, and is even slimming. My new favorite summer dress.",5
"Beautiful dress very ligth,elegant true to it's size.Had alot of compliments on it we brought 5 dresses (all my sisters) wore for our mother's 90th birthday celebration. The dress was a blast and so was her party.",5
"Cute dress, very comfortable, a good bit of stretch to the fabric, slight taper at waistline so it's not boxy. Sleeves are chiffon (thankfully- was worried based on the picture they might be a cotton material). I usually wear size 14 or 16 and an XL fits well with a little room to spare.",5
"Fits great, washes well, and great quality for the price. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. I wish this silhouette was available in other patterns/colors. I would buy them all!",5
"I love these shirts so much I had to pick up a couple more colors. These have a great fit, not to loose or too snug. Perfect weight to wear alone or layer under a sweater. I prefer the v-necks, and these are the perfect v.",5
"I bought a couple of these in heather gray because they were on sale for a good price. When I got it, I immediately ordered another one in black. I love this tank so much. It is long, which I love. I like my shirts long so it balances out tops that might feel short to me. I love that it is light-weight. When it's really hot outside I hate having to layer tops because I overheat. This feels better than layering with a standard cotton tank. It's also very soft and kind of silky so it doesn't grab onto the shirt that you layer over it. This is going to be my standard tank for layering from now on.",5
"I have several of the Ultimate T shirts. I bought this one for the color. Upon receipt, I noted that the color is not as bright as the photo.

"It's a kind of burnout fabric, so it is a bit see through, but with a nude bra, all is fine. I love how it looks with black or white capris underneath. It is very cool for summer. I have it in the dark gray as well. I am 5'5' and an athletic 136 lbs and M works for me perfectly.",5

"True to size and I love the way it looks on! I'm plus size and ordered it in 2x and it fits perfectly not too tight but not too loose either. The length is perfect as well its not too short it lands right in the middle of my thighs.\nJust for reference I'm 5'5 and weigh 216 and carry most of my weight in the stomach/ abdomen area.",5

The shirts seem longer and thinner in the spring and summer, and shorter but thicker in the fall. The longer thinner styles are my favorite, since i live in Texas. Pretty true to color and size, and mine have hold up pretty well. Great shirts!!",5

It is the perfect fit ~ not too tight and not too loose ~ and is super soft but not thin & cheap looking. The length is perfect and the sleeves are not so short that they hit at the most uncomplimentary level of your arm. The colors really bring out the green in my eyes. I might go back and buy a backup.",5

"I first saw this item in stores and tried it on. I loved it so much that I added to my online cart to save to buy for a later date. I could have gotten a size smaller but I wanted to share it with my twin sister. It is very comfortable and not too tight in the arms (which I love) and it has strong seams. The blue is a dark navy blue and matches with almost anything. Very pleased. I ordered this online to pick up in stores and it was fast and easy to complete.",5

"Perfect summer top...lightweight...NO IRON...good for work or casual. Great for travel! (It toured 6 European countries with me this summer! Sink-washable!)\n\nI've worn this with skirt, jeggings, skinny-leg jeans and shorts. Looks fabulous with white pants. Lots of cool summery shades in the print. Generous cut.\n\nI'm ordering a second one as a back-up for next summer for \",5
"I love every single thing about these trousers! The fit, the length, the price, the material... absolutely everything. I wear a 10 Petite from Ann Taylor or LOFT, and this size 10 fit me perfectly.\nI returned to the store to buy more after wearing them for just a few\nmoments. I do hope I continue to see more clothing of this quality for such a fair price in the future. Good job Target!",5
"Fit perfectly! Great easy addition to my wardrobe!",5
"I'm 5'7-5'8 and about 135#. I love merona and know the sizes run a tad larger, so the 2 is good, but I would be swimming in any other size. I work at a library and this looks so cute and professional and I've gotten many compliments on it. I always have trouble finding skirts that are long enough to hit at my knee for a professional work look and this skirt fits the bill. Since I am tall, though, I'm guessing it would probably be too long for anyone with shorter legs.",5
"Love this skirts - great material",5
"This skirt looks great! I'm 5' 6\",5
"These pants are made of a quality fabric which holds the shape. Perfect for fall and even winter. Love the design and a nice twist from the solid black pant. Everyone who sees them can't believe they are from Target. Buying a second pair as I love them!",5
"I wish I had purchased more of these. It is comfortable and stylish.",5
"I like the look of pencil skirts, but hate when they're restrictive. I love the ponte, because it's stretchy, but still thick! I either bought mine a while back or I didn't read the description, because I didn't expect pockets (I never would on a pencil skirt) so that didn't bother me! I actually had to get rid of mine recently because it no longer fit, but I am definitely ordering again in my new size!",5
"This hits all the important points for me: perfect fit, great style and more comfortable than the average pencil skirt. And at $22.99, what more can you ask for?",5
"I'm usually a size 2 but they were a little snug so I bought the size 4 and they were very comfortable. They do stretch out a little after wearing them_like blue jeans. So, I have to wash after each wearing or just put in dryer so they shrink a little. But, the comfort is worth it!",5
"LOVE these pants; I am going to try to order more. Fit great for shorter folks who don't like the extra long pants. I ordered 18S as I am overweight, apple shape. Great for 5'3\",5
"fit just right. has a small 'cap' sleeve. Best part is that the armholes are not super large/wide. Don't have to wear a cami under this, but you could. This blouse is a print, sorta navy and a very light pink, very light! Goes nicely with jeans or black pants.",5
"I wear these to work but they are also comfortable enough to wear anytime, anywhere.",5
"I wear a white tank under, and love the fit, feel, and look of this blouse. Also perfectly matches a necklace that my daughter gave me, so I will get a lot of wear out of it this summer.",5
"I own this shirt in three other colors. It's a flattering length and slightly roomy, enough to be comfortable to work in all day but not too flowy. It looks great with jeans or dress pants for a casual work environment. I love the gold button detail on the sleeve. I plan on buying this shirt in the blue and green too.",5
"Great shirt to match with a tank underneath. Great pattern with vibrant colors. Fits true to size.",5
"love, love, love these!\nvery flattering, looks like ultra suede.",5
"This style is easy and flowy but elegant. Highly recommend.",5
"I so love this top! Only wish there were other color/print combos and I would buy them all. This is a nice quality top but it does take some care. Cold wash - gentle cycle = hang dry. Looks awesome with denim and black boots.",5
"I loved this top. It had vibrant fall like colors and was very loose and flowy. (Next size down would be appropriate) this shirt would have had at least 4 stars if the sleeve didnt rip in the first wash. It ripped on the top part of the arm as the fabric couldnt withstand washing. This shirt is a waste of money unless you handwash and dry.",5
"I was hesitant to give this 5 stars, only because the sizing is off. But everything else makes it worth it! I normally wear an XL, but needed a XXL. It's a nice thick, soft fabric that's so comfortable! As a curvier girl I have trouble finding dresses like this that flatter my mid-section, but this looks great!",5
"I've been seeing faux suede skirts everywhere & really wanted to try out the trend this fall, but none of the others I've come across were quite worth the price. However, I couldn't pass this up when I found it on the clearance rack at a local Target! The material is super soft yet still holds its shape & I really like the laser cut detail at the bottom. According to the size chart I would be an XS, but I found it to be a tight fit so I went for the S instead. As a result, it hits lower & flares out a bit more than pictured on the model, but overall I am very happy with my purchase & can't wait to wear this!",5
"I just bought this less than an hour ago. Vintage style, great fit as if it was tailored just for me. Bought it in a large since my bust size, yet still very fitted around my waist. Fabric is soft against skin and the price was a steal.",5
"I love this dress! I almost didn't try it on in the store because it looked so drab on the hanger. However I put it on and is actually a very flattering dress. It provides a classic shape. And just like the other review I tend to be a bit bigger in the bust so the stretchy fabric gives enough to where I didn't have to go up a size to fit my chest and then be too big in the hips. I have worn it twice and have received a lot of compliments on it. Definitely can't be shy wearing it either. The bold pattern is unique and passes as a vintage chic dress.",5
"Super soft and super cute!",5
"Great romper for work! Super cute easy to dress up and go out for cocktails with the girls I love it. Quality material and I got many compliments when I wear it.",5
"I love this dress. I'm about 5'3-5'4, 118lbs, usually a size 2-4 and usually a small in the juniors department but i got this in an xs and it fits perfectly. The bottom just barely touches the floor with flats on, so it might not be good for really tall girls.",5
"I really like this dress! It\'s so comfortable, the colors are great for the summer, and it flows so nicely! I wore it to work &amp; to a night lounge dressed up with wedges! I got many compliments! ",4
"I wore this dress to church and to work. Received several compliments on it.  Am glad that I bought it, the picture doesn\'t do it justice.  In person the green pops out more but the dress itself is not so loud. I think its a little too loose on top and around the ankles but that\'s a matter of preference I wore it any way and really liked it.",4
"I got this dress in the store.  I am a busty gal and fit a medium perfectly.  With most forever 21 dresses I fit large sometimes having to go to Plus size XL. Wore this to a dinner party with cute sandals and fancy clutch.  Definitely recommend.",4
"this dress is perfect because it has no slits, the weight adds to the look but the fabric is very breezy.  the neon yellow really pops against the gray\/black\/white.  I\'m 5\'3 and the dress was a little bit long but i wore it with flats anyway and belted it to  raise it a bit. Even with a card over it, it was still very breezy. up close, the fabric feels cheap bc its synthetic, but surprisingly doesn\'t irritate on a hot summer day bc the dress flows nicely away from body, drapes very well.  I\'m usually an xs and the small was a little bit loose on the top but it just added to the blouson affect up top, if you r large busted, this would be a good bet. received lots of complements.  must wear slip for modesty reasons bc only top is lined.",4

I\'m usually an xs and the small was a little bit loose on the top but it just added to the blouson affect up top, if you r large busted, this would be a good bet. received lots of complements.  must wear slip for modesty reasons bc only top is lined.",4

I bought them after trying them on, knowing that I will exclusively be able to wear them with a long top. They are pretty high waist, which accentuates the hips, and the elastic is pretty thin. These would have been much more flattering with a lower waist and 3/4 inches band.\nObviously disregard if you're skinny with a perfectly flat stomach...",4

"This blouse runs small. The only size I could find in it was 2 tag sizes too big but it fit fine. I have found most blouses run small.\nThe color is good and it hangs nicely. I do recommend wearing an tank top or undershirt under it because the front is only held in place by a small stich line. If that breaks or tears, everything will be exposed. Other than that, love the blouse!",4
"I'm 6 months pregnant and found this band to alleviate some of my belly and back aches. I can definitely feel a difference when I am wearing it out and about. It helps a ton on long shopping trips or walks. I've only used the heat and cold a handful of times, but was pleased that the beads in the ice/heat pack keep it flexible and comfortable. I wear a 12/14 pre-pregnancy and the ML seems to fit perfectly. I am not sure if it will fit very well as I near the end of my pregnancy and that's probably when I'll need it most! There aren't really any cons to this band, other than velcro issues and getting it lined up properly. It is kind of itchy, so I recommend a shirt underneath.

It was a little difficult for me to get the velcro fastened perfectly, which would then scratch my back, so I had to readjust several times when first putting it on.  Overall, a good product.

I was pregnant during the summer, so kept the beads in the freezer, and cold felt great on my back when I was feeling really hot.  At times the velcro closure would move and would rub on my belly which was uncomfortable.  But over all I was glad to have it.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4
"I have been trying to no avail to find something or some way to keep a heating pad on my lower back while pregnant.  Then I found the Boppy Tummy Support Band.  The TheraPearls that come with the band are AMAZING.  The band keeps the heat where I need it, and the heat lasts long enough to provide the relief I was looking for.  \nHowever the sizing on the band is a little funny.  I am usually a size 10.  I ordered the M/L size, since all of my maternity clothes are either a Medium or Large.  Yet this band is too big for me in regards to providing support for my belly.  Right now I measure 40 inches where the band should sit.  So the band is visible under my clothes since it is so big.  The fabric is nice (similar to a bra), and would hide well under clothes if the fit was better. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4

"I would give this 5 stars if the small piece of fabric that comes with the belts actually worked. I don't use the pieces of fabric at all - just the belt and I have had no problems. The belt has been very convienent and easy to use. The kit I purchased comes with two sizes (small and large) and with two types of fasteners. Two come with buttons and the others come with the slide type of fastener so it is nice for my work pants (all together 4 belts). I am 14 weeks along and still using the small belt and haven't needed to move up to the large belt. I have been able to keep wearing my pre-pregnancy pants and jeans without a problem. The only thing that I have to say is that the fabric pieces that come with the kit aren't very useable and bunch up when you sit and then stand back up. Instead I don't use it and wear longer blouses to cover my unzipped pants. This belt has been great. I recommend it to anyone.",4

All if sudden I began to shrink and at 2 weeks postpartum it isn't as tight as I need it.

It just holds everything in place for me while I try to care for my newborn and do things around the house.

"This is a cute green cardigan. I ordered my normal size online and think it runs a tiny bit small and the arms are pretty tight. Also, the knit doesn't have much stretch to it at all so the arms didn't loosen up much at all during the day like you might expect. I should point out that the black pattern you see on the sweater is actually part of the sweater. For some reason I thought it the knit on the sweater was loose and the black you could see was the shirt the model has on underneath. I still like it though.",4

"The dress has a rigid a-line structure (which I find nice), and the medium weight material is appropriate for cooler nights. The color and material look more elegant in person than in the picture. For reference, my measurements are 34B-27-35 and the xs fits nicely. I think that a girl with a bigger bust might have a problem since the fabric is not very elastic. The only con I find is that the zipper looks rather fragile.",4

I always buy one size larger in hosiery because I don't like them to be too tight and thought that leggings might be the same way, but I was wrong.  I got the size M and they were much too large.  Read the sizing chart on the tag and purchase accordingly!  The fabric is nice and they are comfortable, just too big.",4
"These are more like a soft, opaque footless tight or legging to wear around the house than a workout pant. If you do leave the house, make sure you are wearing a tunic or dress. If they seem a little sheer, then go up a size. On the plus side, they are extremely soft and comfortable. There is a much more expensive version (branded Ingrid and Isabel) that is a little bit softer fabric but same density and design.",4
"I love the way these leggings feel and ordered two of them. I've worn these throughout my pregnancy paried with a long sweater and knee high boots.",4
"I actually purchased this a size larger after reading other reviews, and glad I did because it fits perfect now. I know it is actually meant as a sleep shirt, but I purchased it for out and about with a little jacket over it. The material is nice, but it comes out quite wrinkly from the washer.",4

"Extremely nice material... very soft and stretchy. Your reason it got four stars instead of five because it did not have enough support for large heavy breasts. I think if you were to order a size down that would help with the support because the material is stretchy enough that it would still fit the trunk of your body.",4

They are super comfy, and I wear them all the time, I just can't wear them if I am going to be doing a lot of walking around, because then the drive me crazy.",4
"I find these leggings to be a nice thickness and very comfortable, much more than a few other brands I've purchased. I am 5 months along in my third pregnancy and they fit pretty well. I do agree with others that they tend to sag in the crotch area after awhile, but I think as my belly grows I can pull them up higher and won't have that problem. I got them on sale, so am happy with them!",4
"These are the most comfortable leggings I own! I will probably wear them when I'm not pregnant anymore. The only two improvements I would make is that when you bend over in the right light they can be a little see-through, so watch yourself and that they can get a little stretched out around the ankles, nothing a washing won't fix but sometimes I need to wear mine twice in one week :)",4

I ordered a large because I have a big behind (to say the least haha) so I have to roll the waist band down like yoga pants, but it seems to add more support and helps keep the pants up since they are still a little big. They do pile a bit if not washed on delicate so be careful. Overall I really love them though and just ordered a second pair.",4
"They are nice I like them a lot, but I bought a size M, which I am in all maternity pants and they are too big, will be returning for smaller size. hope a small isn't too small",4
"I hate wearing leggings and constantly feel like my underwear are showing through the material, so these ponte pants are perfect during pregnancy!  My only wish is that they fit a 1/2 size smaller (I got a medium) so that there wasn't so much room in hips/crotch area.  Other than that, great for the money!",4
"Very nice for ease of access when you're extra sleepy during late night feedings. Bought these so I didn't have to sleep in nursing bras with under wire anymore. My only complaint is I have large breasts and they don't necessarily provide support and the straps really dig into my shoulders and across my upper back from the weight of my breasts.",4
"Great looking bra when wearing but has tendency to loosen after use",4
"Love - soft, long, easy to nurse in\nHate - uniboob (this would be the case with any nursing tank I guess)\nDon't wash and dry it with other clothes or it comes out with picked spots all over it. It is fine if washed with similar fabrics and hung to dry.",4
"Extremely nice material... very soft and stretchy. Your reason it got four stars instead of five because it did not have enough support for large heavy breasts. I think if you were to order a size down that would help with the support because the material is stretchy enough that it would still fit the trunk of your body.",4
"The hands-free bra was a much needed relief for me. The bra really does hold the pumps in place and allows you to use your hands while you pump. I am a teacher, so when I went back to work I had to pump during my lunch and planning period. Once I had the bra, I could pump while I ate, and I could check email and grade papers during my planning. Now that I'm out for the summer, it's nice to have my hands free to read a magazine or take care of my infant. I have also washed it a couple of times and no damage was done. There are two reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5: A latch at the top of the zipper would be great to add extra security. Also, since I have only used it for a few weeks, I'm not sure how well it will hold up over time. I can see how the holes could eventually stretch out. However, even if it holds up for a few months, that would be worth it for me.",4
"You still have only the length of your tubing to get around so you can't go around doing chores, etc but it allows for you to do deskwork, read a book, even eat a meal while pumping and prevents wrist hand fatigue. Considering I pump every 3 hours/day, this has been one of the most used items in my household.I have two so if one gets stained with breastmilk, etc I have another one for backup.",4
"This is a great product for hands free pumping. The fit is very true to size and the design makes it very easy to put on.",4
"I received a size L from my registry.  I am still pregnant and a 38-40 D or DD and the L just barely fit me. Because there is no adjustable clasp, just a zipper in front, I knew I had to go online to buy the XL because if I go beyond a 40D when my milk comes in, and I definitely will, it won't zip up. It seems to be made well and came highly recommended from another mom.",4
"I thought that this size would be perfect for me and ordered it when my son was 3 weeks old. I was disappointed in the fit and had difficulty with the zipper, which split when I tried putting the garment on. I initially thought that this was a poor quality product, but then I realized that my boobs were actually growing with the increased feedings since my baby's birth. I ordered a size up (XL) and magically, the garment seemed like it was much sturdier. I use it daily now and it holds up well. When it fits and is on properly, it is very comfortable and makes the whole process less stressful for me. It has actually been very useful to my pumping routine, helping to keep the shields in place and extract more milk.",4
"The bustier has made it so much more convenient to pump, which I do exclusively. It is comfortable, but I would not wear it unless I am going to pump. You don't even have to remove your nursing bra to use. I don't.know if you could use a brand other than Medela with a Medela pump, it is somewhat pricey but the freedom is priceless.",4
"I almost exclusively pump and being attached to the pump every 3 hours, this is a must have. This frees up your hands to eat, work on the computer or hold the baby. I was a 34C pre-pregnancy and ordered a Medium. It is snug, but I think it should be to hold the pump parts in place correctly. I did get a small tear in the seam on the side, which I was disappointed in, but since I do use it 7 times a day, maybe it should be expected. I am going to buy a second one to keep at work while pumping. I would recommend going hands free.",4
"This is the only pumping bustier I could even find at Target, and I still had to go out of my way to pick it up, only to find the size I should have been was too tight. I went to a different Target to exchange for the next size up, and it is still a bit too tight, but not so much that it is more than mildly annoying to put on.",4
"This works well until you produce a lot of milk which causes the suction cup to pull away from the breast and lose suction.",4
"I was just on the boarder between sizes and went with the larger size - glad I did because it is still super tight - I couldn't even have zipped up the medium!\n\nAlso, while this makes it possible to pump hands free, if you have the all in one breast shield set up (where the shields are not separate from the valve/membrane piece) it's a little more cumbersome to get it set up. Just be forewarned.",4
"Pros:\n- hands are free to cook, email, etc while I pump\n- soft, washable, stretchy fabric\n\nCons:\n- difficult to put on since you have to keep the zipper snug to zip it up\n- zipper sometimes fails\n\nBottom Line: I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to any mom that's pumping!",4
"I really liked this, even though it was a little difficult to zip up. Maybe that's just because I'm a bigger gal, but I had a hard time getting it around me and then holding it in place to put the zipper end in, then pull it up without the zipper flying apart again.",4
"This makes it so much easier to pump! I can get other things accomplished! Before I bought this, I was stuck sitting there watching the world go by while pumping, now I can do things other than watch television while pumping!",4
"Glad that I bought this item. As suggested by some reviews I got one size up from what was shown for me in the sizing guide. It's still very tight, but that's because it's supposed to be. It does give me a slight backache because of the constriction, but only really when I slouch. I tuck the motor part into the back of my pants when I need to get walk around or get some stuff done while pumping, which makes it SUPER convenient. So far, pumping 6-8 times per day, I have not had any issues with the zipper, though I can see how it could easily break.",4
"It's been a week since I gave birth and I finally got one of these. I bought one prior to giving birth, but it was too small and when I went to return it, they didn't have the larger size available. I really like the product, but I hate the Zipper! I wish they would have made it with buttons or hooks. My zipper is stuck, so I had to pull it over my head to use it. Other than that, it's a great product!",4
"Runs small. Current bra size is 36 C so I ordered the medium. It's a little snug, but I think it helps hold everything in place. I wish it had snaps or Velcro instead of a zipper as it is frustrating to zip up sometimes. I found it easier to put the bra on, zip it up, and then put the pumps through the holes. Sometimes you still have to hold pump for suction/positioning, but it's better than nothing!",4
"Seems like after the first time I used it it stretched out so I need to wear another nursing bra under it so it's not constantly falling while I pump.  I ordered the size it said I should have but wish I would have ordered a smaller one.  Seems a little over priced for what it is but all Medela products seem to be that way.",4
"I would recommend this to everyone who has to pump.  I pumped for a few weeks without using one and it was a pain to hold the bottles and not being able to use my hands.  The bustier fits a little tight, but it is not uncomfortable.",4
"Really comfy bra. Only reason I don't give it all stars is bc its not super supportive but it would need an underwire for that and I'd prefer comfort right now.",4
"I was nervous about ordering online, I'm a DD and went to a DDD after becoming pregnant. Ordering any kind of bra is annoying for me. I figured this would be like wearing a sports bra but it's much more comfy than one! And it also doesn't smash my boobs like sports bras do!",4
"I ordered this about a week before I had my daughter, and unfortunately am unable to nurse. However, I do wear this around the house because it is super comfortable. I may even use it as a workout bra as it fits me similarly to a sports bra.",4
"I bought this few days ago, I still haven't used it, I'm 5\",4
"I'm 5'3\",4
"This bra is very comfortable and I'm happy with my purchase. I'm normally a 34 D or DD and bought a 34 F/G and it just fits now (8 months pregnant), but I'm worried that when my milk comes in it won't fit. I had to use the extender that came with the bra and I'm just fitting into the cups. It also gives me a uni-boob look, but at this point the comfort that I feel from this bra compared to the ones I was wearing before outweighs the uni-boob look. I would recommend this bra but I would consider buying a size bigger than you think you'll need if you're a larger chested woman like myself.",4
"I like this bra but prefer the silk seamless style also by Bravado - I got both when I purchased this one and this one is just not as stretchy. It offers good support and the piping in orchid is very pretty!",4
"I bought this bra because I needed something to hold nursing pads at night before my baby was even born. It is super comfortable and unlike T-back bras I've tried, the U-shape in the back is much more comfortable and doesn't ride up at all while I'm sleeping. No tags or itchy seams either. I bought a large and an x-large. I was a 34B before, now I'm a 36D. The large fits great and I'm hoping the x-large will work when my milk comes in (although it fits now too). Can't speak to how it works for nursing yet.",4
"I had my mother in law buy me a nursing bra because I could not find one I liked in the store. This is a pretty full figure nursing bra ( I wear a 40F) with some light padding. (It's hard to tell my true size now as my sizes keeps changing) Very comfortable and easy to use. the cups are shaped nicely and there is no underwire. Overall it's a great bra. My reason for not 5 stars - I wanted black!",4
"Don't waste money buying the Medela one. This one fits much better as it is adjustable.",4
"This bra has been so helpful for pumping at work. I don't know what I would do without it. I like that the size is adjustable, so it can fit anyone..",4
"As I'm in my final trimester, I have yet to use this bustier. However, I have been comparing it to others that I have seen & can honestly say that this one appears to be much better constructed than others on the market. The price point is very comparable to others but might be cheaper on Target.com if you're purchasing a large $$ amount [...] friend of mine highly recommends a hands-free bustier for pumping & sends all of her NICU moms to purchase one from the gift shop in the hospital & all of the moms rave about it. So, that leads me to think that this item is going to be very invaluable in the future.",4
"I am happy with this hands free bra. I love that you can adjust to a different size. I also like that you can have the zipper either starting at the top or bottom. This one is definitely worth the money compared to others on the market.",4
"I am an exclusive pumper, so I use this bra a lot. It fits comfortably and has the option to include shoulder straps. My washer ate the zipper though :( Also, I believe the price is cheaper on Amazon than it is through Target.",4
"It was nice to have my hands free to read, snack or fold the laundry.",4
"The hands free pumping bra is prefect for the working mom. I am able to continue checking email or read documents while pumping. This makes it much easier to not skip a pumping session knowing I can still get things done.",4
"Does a great job of holding up heavy flanges + milk filled bottles. Completely hands free and no worries that it will slip or sag. For all day wear it is less than ideal, especially in warm climates. Also provides minimal support for your breasts.",4
"This product is a great help as I am exclusively pumping and appreciate being able to use my hands while pumping. It allows me to continue to work while at work or relax while pumping at home instead of holding my arms up for 20+ minutes every three hours.\n\nThe drawback is one size does not fit all in the width between breasts. I had to go to the Lansioch website to order an extra panel for the front before it worked properly. The panel was only $3 but it was a pain to have to make a second order and wait again for the shipment.",4
"I am really happy with my purchase. I wish these sizes are sold in stores, but that is the way things are. The bra sits in place , and adjustable for the perfect fit. I would recommend this bra to any mom.",4
"So the awesome thing about this bra is that it's expandable. It actually comes with two pieces so it can expand to the right size. On the down side, even at it's longest it is still feels a little tight for my 38B postpartum. \n\nIt works great to hold my pump flanges so I have hands free pumping and can take care of my baby while pumping (or whatever else I need to do). The fabric is nice and soft so it doesn't feel like it's ripping my skin off. I also like that it comes with optional straps that can be worn multiple ways or not at all.",4
"This bra works ok for a hands free pump. Not very comfortable to wear all day. This bra has extras from the medulla bra which ends up getting in the way. I do like the zipper change though.",4
"Material was a little thinner than I expected, but it totally does the job I needed - holding up my dress pants that don't quite close over the baby belly anymore!",4
"I love these leggings, now that I am in 3rd trimester.  The crotch area is huge and I am constantly pulling them up.  It is a little better now that Im in 3rd tri but still a problem.  They are super comfy, and I wear them all the time, I just can't wear them if I am going to be doing a lot of walking around, because then the drive me crazy.",4
"I find these leggings to be a nice thickness and very comfortable, much more than a few other brands I've purchased. I am 5 months along in my third pregnancy and they fit pretty well. I do agree with others that they tend to sag in the crotch area after awhile, but I think as my belly grows I can pull them up higher and won't have that problem. I got them on sale, so am happy with them!",4
"These are the most comfortable leggings I own! I will probably wear them when I'm not pregnant anymore. The only two improvements I would make is that when you bend over in the right light they can be a little see-through, so watch yourself and that they can get a little stretched out around the ankles, nothing a washing won't fix but sometimes I need to wear mine twice in one week :)",4
"These are very comfortable, and look great on. The only drawback is that I feel like they slide down. I'm only 13 weeks, so I might not have enough of a \",4

"I bought my belly bandit prior to my c section delivery in hopes of bouncing back to my pre-pregnancy body since I've always had an athletic build. I was a size 1 before pregnancy and so I purchased an XS. I disappointed when I tried to wear it 4 days postpartum and it wouldn't even close! I even filled out a return slip but tried it 2 days later out of curiousity and it barely closed so I kept it. All if sudden I began to shrink and at 2 weeks postpartum it isn't as tight as I need it. I loved the support it provided to my weak core and I definitely think it helped to shrink my waist but I had to dock it a star on my rating because I feel like now I need an XXS and there isn't one available.",4

I'm not sure if it's helping me get down to my pre pregnant belly size any faster (this is my first baby), but it's crazy how much more comfortable I feel when I wear it. It just holds everything in place for me while I try to care for my newborn and do things around the house. Only complaint is that it's not all that conspicuous under clothes, but I'm not really going anywhere in anything but tshirts right now anyway. I recommend the Belly Bandit to any of my pregnant friends.",4

"They are nice I like them a lot, but I bought a size M, which I am in all maternity pants and they are too big, will be returning for smaller size. hope a small isn't too small",4
"I hate wearing leggings and constantly feel like my underwear are showing through the material, so these ponte pants are perfect during pregnancy!  My only wish is that they fit a 1/2 size smaller (I got a medium) so that there wasn't so much room in hips/crotch area.  Other than that, great for the money!",4
"Really comfy bra. Only reason I don't give it all stars is bc its not super supportive but it would need an underwire for that and I'd prefer comfort right now.",4
"I was nervous about ordering online, I'm a DD and went to a DDD after becoming pregnant. Ordering any kind of bra is annoying for me. I figured this would be like wearing a sports bra but it's much more comfy than one! And it also doesn't smash my boobs like sports bras do!",4
"I ordered this about a week before I had my daughter, and unfortunately am unable to nurse. However, I do wear this around the house because it is super comfortable. I may even use it as a workout bra as it fits me similarly to a sports bra.",4
"I like that it keeps lotion off my clothes but the sizing seems a bit too large. I'm 24 weeks and about 114 pounds and the XS bunches up and tends to fall off a bit. Maybe in a couple more months it'll work better. I will definitely be buying the post-pregnancy gear a little later on just based on the quality of the product.",4
"On days when my back aches, I wear the Upsie Bandit belt and it's fantastic. On days when I want support but don't need the Upsie belt, I like this alternative. It provides good support and keeps the stretch mark cream from getting all over my clothes.",4
"This bra is functional, comfortable, everything a good nursing bra should be, but it is NOT cute at all. I feel like a grandma in it. All in all, if you are looking for function, this has it, but plan on getting another bra all together if you are looking to feel pretty.",4
"I actually purchased this a size larger after reading other reviews, and glad I did because it fits perfect now. I know it is actually meant as a sleep shirt, but I purchased it for out and about with a little jacket over it. The material is nice, but it comes out quite wrinkly from the washer.",4
"The white runs small and is see through.",4

"I wanted to support Ava & Viv as the plus size offering in the store stinks. I will say that this is a cute t-shirt. Just average. It is pretty thin, but is similar in length as the picture. I just needed something to go with a pair of jeans and it was fine.",4
"Soft, nice cut and simple but not plain. I would order once size up though",4
"Just received this today, it's just what I needed.",4
"I bought this dress for New Years Eve. Thankfully, I ordered about a month early, because I have had to send this dress back twice to size down. I am not a small girl; I usually wear an 18-20/2X, and tend to buy a 20 in all dresses that I wear. That being said, I initially purchased this dress in a 20, and when it arrived at my house and I tried it on, it was ridiculously large. It looked really baggy and boxy in the chest area (not a normal thing for me to experience with 44Ds), and the due to it being so large, the dress was just kind of.... there. It had no shape or life to it at all.\nI returned the dress and sized down to an 18. When the second dress arrived, I tried it on, and it was still pretty baggy. The shape had improved, and it was a lot more flattering than the 20 had been, but it was definitely still too large.\nI ultimately ended up fitting nicely into a size 16, and am absolutely in love with the way this dress looks with a red shoe and a red lip.\n\nMoral of the story: If you plan to purchase this dress, plan to size down at least one size.",4
"Where i usually take a large in dresses, I needed a medium in this dress. The quality is good for the price.",4
"I bought this for my daughter, she liked it a lot but found the fabric to sheer. She did return it but did like the style and print.",4
"I bought this dress for a black tie wedding I love it",4
"I'm 5'3 and 132 lbs. Tried on both size 6 and size 8. Same at knee length, only difference is size 8 has wider neckline (actually shows a gap at the back of the neck) and roomier bust. Very pretty and comfortable though.",4
"Absolutely love these jeans.!! They don't pinch my belly rolls and are soft and stretchy. Lovely fit for me.\nI wish they had more colors.",4
"This is a very thin waffle knit that I found in the store. What was unusual is that some of the colors had a softer feel to the fabric. The gorgeous Sea Ship blue one, for instance, was very scratchy and the neckline looked a little uneven. The olive, the gray, and the maroon (really a lavenderish purple) were all very soft. I didn't touch all of the colors - sorry! I purchased this in the olive (Woody Green) in the store, and ordered the maroon one online. The color swatches and the names are not matching up right on here!",4

It is long enough to wear with leggings and has a loose but flattering fit.The only thing is that the material (cotton-ish) is a little heavier than expected and a little scratchy.

Would prefer all cotton, but this fills a hole in my wardrobe right now.",4

However, they do bag out quite a bit as the day wears on.\n\nThis is my first pair of Merona pants and I think the 2 fit more like a 4 in other brands.",4

"This looks adorable over a maxi dress or with a tank top where you want a little bit more coverage. I do feel like it runs a little small but I expected that since it's juniors. I worry that the fringe will not do well in the wash so I plan on putting it in a mesh bag when I wash it.",4
"I just bought this jacket and it is really great for the price. I actually like the fact that the faux shearling is only on the collar and not the entire lining, which adds warmth, but too much bulk. My only complaint is the sizing. I am always, no matter what brand or store, a size medium in a denim jacket. The arms were way too tight. I had to size up to a large for the arms and shoulders, so now the waist is too loose. The distressing is really nice, so I am definitely keeping it.",4

For reference, my measurements are 34B-27-35 and the xs fits nicely. I think that a girl with a bigger bust might have a problem since the fabric is not very elastic.

The 4 is snug and I probably could use a 6 but they don't have the size anymore. A larger size might have armholes that are too big though. The hem comes to about 1.5 inches above my knee (but I am very short). The arrived very wrinkly. I've included a photo. I think a younger person with better lighting who owned an iron might do this dress more justice than I. It's not perfect but I didn't expect haute couture.",4

I deducted one star for the tie back because I find ties and drawstrings in general a pain to deal with, especially if the drawstring comes loose in the wash. Will cross that bridge later; right now, I am loving the fit and comfort of this dress. XS hits above my knee at 5'2\",4

For reference im a 27 waist and ordered a Medium based on previous Target bathing suit orders. These run very small in my opinion, so size up but very cute!",4
"I'm typically a size 2, but I carry my weight at my hips. Small is the bathing suit size I buy, but this in small was too small for me. The scallops stayed in place on the butt and made it flirty and sexy without showing too much. However, the scallops on the waist were folded over. I think it may have been from it being too small. Re-ordered in the medium.",4

"I'm 6 months pregnant and found this band to alleviate some of my belly and back aches. I can definitely feel a difference when I am wearing it out and about. It helps a ton on long shopping trips or walks. I've only used the heat and cold a handful of times, but was pleased that the beads in the ice/heat pack keep it flexible and comfortable. I wear a 12/14 pre-pregnancy and the ML seems to fit perfectly. I am not sure if it will fit very well as I near the end of my pregnancy and that's probably when I'll need it most! There aren't really any cons to this band, other than velcro issues and getting it lined up properly. It is kind of itchy, so I recommend a shirt underneath. I would recommend this for anyone suffering from belly and back pain, even if they are not pregnant!\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4
"During my last month of pregnancy when my stomach was at its largest, this product was very helpful.  I actually realized how much support it was providing when I removed it each day.  I was not able to use the cold/heat pack because it states you should not use that part while pregnant.  It was a little difficult for me to get the velcro fastened perfectly, which would then scratch my back, so I had to readjust several times when first putting it on.  Overall, a good product.  Probably not a MUST have, but nice support at the end of pregnancy or if you have back problems.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4
"I got this band in my 37th week of pregnancy.  I haven't had horrible back pain, but this really did help me feel more supported.  I was pregnant during the summer, so kept the beads in the freezer, and cold felt great on my back when I was feeling really hot.  At times the velcro closure would move and would rub on my belly which was uncomfortable.  But over all I was glad to have it.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4
"I have been trying to no avail to find something or some way to keep a heating pad on my lower back while pregnant.  Then I found the Boppy Tummy Support Band.  The TheraPearls that come with the band are AMAZING.  The band keeps the heat where I need it, and the heat lasts long enough to provide the relief I was looking for.  \nHowever the sizing on the band is a little funny.  I am usually a size 10.  I ordered the M/L size, since all of my maternity clothes are either a Medium or Large.  Yet this band is too big for me in regards to providing support for my belly.  Right now I measure 40 inches where the band should sit.  So the band is visible under my clothes since it is so big.  The fabric is nice (similar to a bra), and would hide well under clothes if the fit was better. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4

"I'm 6 months pregnant and found this band to alleviate some of my belly and back aches. I can definitely feel a difference when I am wearing it out and about. It helps a ton on long shopping trips or walks. I've only used the heat and cold a handful of times, but was pleased that the beads in the ice/heat pack keep it flexible and comfortable. I wear a 12/14 pre-pregnancy and the ML seems to fit perfectly. I am not sure if it will fit very well as I near the end of my pregnancy and that's probably when I'll need it most! There aren't really any cons to this band, other than velcro issues and getting it lined up properly. It is kind of itchy, so I recommend a shirt underneath.

"I am 5'2 and only 19.5 weeks pregnant. I work in a factory 8-10 hrs a day and had back pain from standing before becoming pregnant. The past couple of weeks of intense work has taken a toll on my back. After researching different bands, I decided to splurge on this one. I measured around my tummy and am at 41\",4

"If you're like me, and not at all ready to slip into oversized, elastic maternity wear, then this could be just the thing. I'm now over 6 months pregnant and still using it. It's not a perfect solution, works better with some of my pants than others, but all in all, it's way better than using rubber bands and safety pins!",4
"I bought this when I was about 2 months pregnant to expand the life of my regular jeans, I loved the different sizes and different buttons and the different colors for every outfit, what I didn't love was the little piece you attached that is supposed to \",4
"I think this was a pretty neat invention and have found it useful. I'm not sure it will work later in pregnancy but we'll give it a good try. after reading another review, I too, am using it with the belly band.",4
"What a great idea for the beginning of a pregnancy. I showed right away and at 4 weeks couldn't button my pants. The Belly Belt Combo was a lifesaver. . .I had not problem wearing my own pants with these extenders and it's so much better than the old rubber band trick!",4
"I would give this 5 stars if the small piece of fabric that comes with the belts actually worked. I don't use the pieces of fabric at all - just the belt and I have had no problems. The belt has been very convienent and easy to use. The kit I purchased comes with two sizes (small and large) and with two types of fasteners. Two come with buttons and the others come with the slide type of fastener so it is nice for my work pants (all together 4 belts). I am 14 weeks along and still using the small belt and haven't needed to move up to the large belt. I have been able to keep wearing my pre-pregnancy pants and jeans without a problem. The only thing that I have to say is that the fabric pieces that come with the kit aren't very useable and bunch up when you sit and then stand back up. Instead I don't use it and wear longer blouses to cover my unzipped pants. This belt has been great. I recommend it to anyone.",4
"so far this is saving me from having to buy new clothes as i am too small for maternity but slightly outgrowing my current clothes size...this is definitely helping my very tight budget and hopefully allow me to hold off on a shopping spree!",4
"I was able to use the belly belt for the first 7 months of my pregnancy and didn't have to buy maternity pants! After 7 months, it was harder to hide the zipper part of my jeans without a longer shirt. Overall, great investment...for at least the first half of pregnancy.",4
"I purchased this product using the sizing chart provided. I was nervous about it fitting. I began using the product 1 day after I gave birth and it fit great and began working right away! I still had my pregnant belly, of course, right after I gave birth. Within one day of wearing the Belly Bandit I noticed a significant difference, and the next day, and the next. I gave birth on December 19th and now 6 days later I am down more than 17 pounds and my belly is not sagging; it's starting to look like normal. The product did crease a little in the back but so does ANY product I purchase that acts as a \",4
"I bought my belly bandit prior to my c section delivery in hopes of bouncing back to my pre-pregnancy body since I've always had an athletic build. I was a size 1 before pregnancy and so I purchased an XS. I disappointed when I tried to wear it 4 days postpartum and it wouldn't even close! I even filled out a return slip but tried it 2 days later out of curiousity and it barely closed so I kept it. All if sudden I began to shrink and at 2 weeks postpartum it isn't as tight as I need it. I loved the support it provided to my weak core and I definitely think it helped to shrink my waist but I had to dock it a star on my rating because I feel like now I need an XXS and there isn't one available.",4
"I bought this 2 days before I had my baby, and put it 1 day after my baby was born. Belly bandit definitely help keep everything nice and tight. The only I do not like is the bunching this wrap will do.",4
"After reviewing other options with my PT, we decided to get this band to help my an separation. In one week, it worked better than regular therapy would in a month. I did have an issue of it collapsing, but I dealt with it. I highly recommend this!",4
"I'm only on my fourth day of wearing the Original Belly Bandit, but I love this thing! I'm not sure if it's helping me get down to my pre pregnant belly size any faster (this is my first baby), but it's crazy how much more comfortable I feel when I wear it. It just holds everything in place for me while I try to care for my newborn and do things around the house. Only complaint is that it's not all that conspicuous under clothes, but I'm not really going anywhere in anything but tshirts right now anyway. I recommend the Belly Bandit to any of my pregnant friends.",4
"I used my belly bandit after having my baby boy. I liked how it held everything in place. It was a little uncomfortable at first and the velcro was a little bulky so I had to wear baggy clothes so it wouldn't be noticeable that I was wearing one.... but my belly shrank down in size pretty fast so I'm glad I bought one. I probably should have bought two because it wasn't long before I needed a smaller size.",4
"Ive had my Belly Bandit for a good three years now,ad I must say this is the best thing to have right after having your baby! I had my 3rd repeat C section and this def helped with an easier recovery process, and through ny breastfeeding journey it has given me better posture. With proper care my wrap has lasted me three years and two babies later. Some people can't believe I had my third baby a couple weeks ago, which is a great thing and I could not have done it without Belly Bandit.",4
"I bought this before I even had my baby girl, and I'm so glad I did. I had a c-section, and was worried it would sit too close to it or would irritate my incision, but it doesn't. The only issue I have with the belly bandit is I am petite, only 5\",4
"I like that it keeps lotion off my clothes but the sizing seems a bit too large. I'm 24 weeks and about 114 pounds and the XS bunches up and tends to fall off a bit. Maybe in a couple more months it'll work better. I will definitely be buying the post-pregnancy gear a little later on just based on the quality of the product.",4
"On days when my back aches, I wear the Upsie Bandit belt and it's fantastic. On days when I want support but don't need the Upsie belt, I like this alternative. It provides good support and keeps the stretch mark cream from getting all over my clothes.",4
"Material was a little thinner than I expected, but it totally does the job I needed - holding up my dress pants that don't quite close over the baby belly anymore!",4
"I got the white in size 4 and it looks really good for someone who doesnt want to dress like a 20s. I feel its age appropriate for late 30s.",4

"During my last month of pregnancy when my stomach was at its largest, this product was very helpful.  I actually realized how much support it was providing when I removed it each day.  I was not able to use the cold/heat pack because it states you should not use that part while pregnant.  It was a little difficult for me to get the velcro fastened perfectly, which would then scratch my back, so I had to readjust several times when first putting it on.  Overall, a good product.

"I got this band in my 37th week of pregnancy.  I haven't had horrible back pain, but this really did help me feel more supported.  I was pregnant during the summer, so kept the beads in the freezer, and cold felt great on my back when I was feeling really hot.  At times the velcro closure would move and would rub on my belly which was uncomfortable.  But over all I was glad to have it.\n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4
"I have been trying to no avail to find something or some way to keep a heating pad on my lower back while pregnant.  Then I found the Boppy Tummy Support Band.  The TheraPearls that come with the band are AMAZING.  The band keeps the heat where I need it, and the heat lasts long enough to provide the relief I was looking for.  \nHowever the sizing on the band is a little funny.  I am usually a size 10.  I ordered the M/L size, since all of my maternity clothes are either a Medium or Large.  Yet this band is too big for me in regards to providing support for my belly.  Right now I measure 40 inches where the band should sit.  So the band is visible under my clothes since it is so big.  The fabric is nice (similar to a bra), and would hide well under clothes if the fit was better. \n\nThe author of this review received a free sample of the product.",4

"I like that these leggings are thick. I'm 5'2\",4
"I picked up a pair of these leggings in a Target store.  I always buy one size larger in hosiery because I don't like them to be too tight and thought that leggings might be the same way, but I was wrong.  I got the size M and they were much too large.  Read the sizing chart on the tag and purchase accordingly!  The fabric is nice and they are comfortable, just too big.",4
"These are more like a soft, opaque footless tight or legging to wear around the house than a workout pant. If you do leave the house, make sure you are wearing a tunic or dress. If they seem a little sheer, then go up a size. On the plus side, they are extremely soft and comfortable. There is a much more expensive version (branded Ingrid and Isabel) that is a little bit softer fabric but same density and design.",4
"I love the way these leggings feel and ordered two of them. I've worn these throughout my pregnancy paried with a long sweater and knee high boots.",4
"I actually purchased this a size larger after reading other reviews, and glad I did because it fits perfect now. I know it is actually meant as a sleep shirt, but I purchased it for out and about with a little jacket over it. The material is nice, but it comes out quite wrinkly from the washer.",4
"Love - soft, long, easy to nurse in\nHate - uniboob (this would be the case with any nursing tank I guess)\nDon't wash and dry it with other clothes or it comes out with picked spots all over it. It is fine if washed with similar fabrics and hung to dry.",4
"Extremely nice material... very soft and stretchy. Your reason it got four stars instead of five because it did not have enough support for large heavy breasts. I think if you were to order a size down that would help with the support because the material is stretchy enough that it would still fit the trunk of your body.",4
"I love these leggings, now that I am in 3rd trimester.  The crotch area is huge and I am constantly pulling them up.  It is a little better now that Im in 3rd tri but still a problem.  They are super comfy, and I wear them all the time, I just can't wear them if I am going to be doing a lot of walking around, because then the drive me crazy.",4
"I find these leggings to be a nice thickness and very comfortable, much more than a few other brands I've purchased. I am 5 months along in my third pregnancy and they fit pretty well. I do agree with others that they tend to sag in the crotch area after awhile, but I think as my belly grows I can pull them up higher and won't have that problem. I got them on sale, so am happy with them!",4
"These are the most comfortable leggings I own! I will probably wear them when I'm not pregnant anymore. The only two improvements I would make is that when you bend over in the right light they can be a little see-through, so watch yourself and that they can get a little stretched out around the ankles, nothing a washing won't fix but sometimes I need to wear mine twice in one week :)",4
"These are very comfortable, and look great on. The only drawback is that I feel like they slide down. I'm only 13 weeks, so I might not have enough of a \",4
"Very nice for ease of access when you're extra sleepy during late night feedings. Bought these so I didn't have to sleep in nursing bras with under wire anymore. My only complaint is I have large breasts and they don't necessarily provide support and the straps really dig into my shoulders and across my upper back from the weight of my breasts.",4
"The white runs small and is see through.",4
"I am 5'2\",4
"I was a size 6-8 pre-pregnancy, so I ordered a medium. Right now, they are huge over my belly, but I'm only in my second trimester. I wear my belly band with them now, and it works perfectly. I like that they provide more coverage than leggings. They're somewhat form fitting but not tight at all.",4
"They're comfy and thicker, so definitely not \",4
"Perfect pair of \",4
"I love how comfy these pants are. I bought them when I was only 11 weeks and they were rather large at that time but now at 16 weeks they fit much better. I ordered a large because I have a big behind (to say the least haha) so I have to roll the waist band down like yoga pants, but it seems to add more support and helps keep the pants up since they are still a little big. They do pile a bit if not washed on delicate so be careful. Overall I really love them though and just ordered a second pair.",4
"They are nice I like them a lot, but I bought a size M, which I am in all maternity pants and they are too big, will be returning for smaller size. hope a small isn't too small",4
"I hate wearing leggings and constantly feel like my underwear are showing through the material, so these ponte pants are perfect during pregnancy!  My only wish is that they fit a 1/2 size smaller (I got a medium) so that there wasn't so much room in hips/crotch area.  Other than that, great for the money!",4

"The hands-free bra was a much needed relief for me. The bra really does hold the pumps in place and allows you to use your hands while you pump. I am a teacher, so when I went back to work I had to pump during my lunch and planning period. Once I had the bra, I could pump while I ate, and I could check email and grade papers during my planning. Now that I'm out for the summer, it's nice to have my hands free to read a magazine or take care of my infant. I have also washed it a couple of times and no damage was done. There are two reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5: A latch at the top of the zipper would be great to add extra security. Also, since I have only used it for a few weeks, I'm not sure how well it will hold up over time. I can see how the holes could eventually stretch out. However, even if it holds up for a few months, that would be worth it for me.",4
"You still have only the length of your tubing to get around so you can't go around doing chores, etc but it allows for you to do deskwork, read a book, even eat a meal while pumping and prevents wrist hand fatigue. Considering I pump every 3 hours/day, this has been one of the most used items in my household.I have two so if one gets stained with breastmilk, etc I have another one for backup.",4
"This is a great product for hands free pumping. The fit is very true to size and the design makes it very easy to put on.",4
"I received a size L from my registry.  I am still pregnant and a 38-40 D or DD and the L just barely fit me. Because there is no adjustable clasp, just a zipper in front, I knew I had to go online to buy the XL because if I go beyond a 40D when my milk comes in, and I definitely will, it won't zip up. It seems to be made well and came highly recommended from another mom.",4
"I thought that this size would be perfect for me and ordered it when my son was 3 weeks old. I was disappointed in the fit and had difficulty with the zipper, which split when I tried putting the garment on. I initially thought that this was a poor quality product, but then I realized that my boobs were actually growing with the increased feedings since my baby's birth. I ordered a size up (XL) and magically, the garment seemed like it was much sturdier. I use it daily now and it holds up well. When it fits and is on properly, it is very comfortable and makes the whole process less stressful for me. It has actually been very useful to my pumping routine, helping to keep the shields in place and extract more milk.",4
"The bustier has made it so much more convenient to pump, which I do exclusively. It is comfortable, but I would not wear it unless I am going to pump. You don't even have to remove your nursing bra to use. I don't.know if you could use a brand other than Medela with a Medela pump, it is somewhat pricey but the freedom is priceless.",4
"I almost exclusively pump and being attached to the pump every 3 hours, this is a must have. This frees up your hands to eat, work on the computer or hold the baby. I was a 34C pre-pregnancy and ordered a Medium. It is snug, but I think it should be to hold the pump parts in place correctly. I did get a small tear in the seam on the side, which I was disappointed in, but since I do use it 7 times a day, maybe it should be expected. I am going to buy a second one to keep at work while pumping. I would recommend going hands free.",4
"This is the only pumping bustier I could even find at Target, and I still had to go out of my way to pick it up, only to find the size I should have been was too tight. I went to a different Target to exchange for the next size up, and it is still a bit too tight, but not so much that it is more than mildly annoying to put on.",4
"This works well until you produce a lot of milk which causes the suction cup to pull away from the breast and lose suction.",4
"I was just on the boarder between sizes and went with the larger size - glad I did because it is still super tight - I couldn't even have zipped up the medium!\n\nAlso, while this makes it possible to pump hands free, if you have the all in one breast shield set up (where the shields are not separate from the valve/membrane piece) it's a little more cumbersome to get it set up. Just be forewarned.",4
"Pros:\n- hands are free to cook, email, etc while I pump\n- soft, washable, stretchy fabric\n\nCons:\n- difficult to put on since you have to keep the zipper snug to zip it up\n- zipper sometimes fails\n\nBottom Line: I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to any mom that's pumping!",4
"I really liked this, even though it was a little difficult to zip up. Maybe that's just because I'm a bigger gal, but I had a hard time getting it around me and then holding it in place to put the zipper end in, then pull it up without the zipper flying apart again.",4
"This makes it so much easier to pump! I can get other things accomplished! Before I bought this, I was stuck sitting there watching the world go by while pumping, now I can do things other than watch television while pumping!",4
"Glad that I bought this item. As suggested by some reviews I got one size up from what was shown for me in the sizing guide. It's still very tight, but that's because it's supposed to be. It does give me a slight backache because of the constriction, but only really when I slouch. I tuck the motor part into the back of my pants when I need to get walk around or get some stuff done while pumping, which makes it SUPER convenient. So far, pumping 6-8 times per day, I have not had any issues with the zipper, though I can see how it could easily break.",4
"It's been a week since I gave birth and I finally got one of these. I bought one prior to giving birth, but it was too small and when I went to return it, they didn't have the larger size available. I really like the product, but I hate the Zipper! I wish they would have made it with buttons or hooks. My zipper is stuck, so I had to pull it over my head to use it. Other than that, it's a great product!",4
"Runs small. Current bra size is 36 C so I ordered the medium. It's a little snug, but I think it helps hold everything in place. I wish it had snaps or Velcro instead of a zipper as it is frustrating to zip up sometimes. I found it easier to put the bra on, zip it up, and then put the pumps through the holes. Sometimes you still have to hold pump for suction/positioning, but it's better than nothing!",4
"Seems like after the first time I used it it stretched out so I need to wear another nursing bra under it so it's not constantly falling while I pump.  I ordered the size it said I should have but wish I would have ordered a smaller one.  Seems a little over priced for what it is but all Medela products seem to be that way.",4
"I would recommend this to everyone who has to pump.  I pumped for a few weeks without using one and it was a pain to hold the bottles and not being able to use my hands.  The bustier fits a little tight, but it is not uncomfortable.",4
"Really comfy bra. Only reason I don't give it all stars is bc its not super supportive but it would need an underwire for that and I'd prefer comfort right now.",4
"I was nervous about ordering online, I'm a DD and went to a DDD after becoming pregnant. Ordering any kind of bra is annoying for me. I figured this would be like wearing a sports bra but it's much more comfy than one! And it also doesn't smash my boobs like sports bras do!",4
"I ordered this about a week before I had my daughter, and unfortunately am unable to nurse. However, I do wear this around the house because it is super comfortable. I may even use it as a workout bra as it fits me similarly to a sports bra.",4
"I bought this few days ago, I still haven't used it, I'm 5\",4
"I'm 5'3\",4
"This bra is very comfortable and I'm happy with my purchase. I'm normally a 34 D or DD and bought a 34 F/G and it just fits now (8 months pregnant), but I'm worried that when my milk comes in it won't fit. I had to use the extender that came with the bra and I'm just fitting into the cups. It also gives me a uni-boob look, but at this point the comfort that I feel from this bra compared to the ones I was wearing before outweighs the uni-boob look. I would recommend this bra but I would consider buying a size bigger than you think you'll need if you're a larger chested woman like myself.",4
"I like this bra but prefer the silk seamless style also by Bravado - I got both when I purchased this one and this one is just not as stretchy. It offers good support and the piping in orchid is very pretty!",4
"I bought this bra because I needed something to hold nursing pads at night before my baby was even born. It is super comfortable and unlike T-back bras I've tried, the U-shape in the back is much more comfortable and doesn't ride up at all while I'm sleeping. No tags or itchy seams either. I bought a large and an x-large. I was a 34B before, now I'm a 36D. The large fits great and I'm hoping the x-large will work when my milk comes in (although it fits now too). Can't speak to how it works for nursing yet.",4
"I had my mother in law buy me a nursing bra because I could not find one I liked in the store. This is a pretty full figure nursing bra ( I wear a 40F) with some light padding. (It's hard to tell my true size now as my sizes keeps changing) Very comfortable and easy to use. the cups are shaped nicely and there is no underwire. Overall it's a great bra. My reason for not 5 stars - I wanted black!",4
"Don't waste money buying the Medela one. This one fits much better as it is adjustable.",4
"This bra has been so helpful for pumping at work. I don't know what I would do without it. I like that the size is adjustable, so it can fit anyone..",4
"As I'm in my final trimester, I have yet to use this bustier. However, I have been comparing it to others that I have seen & can honestly say that this one appears to be much better constructed than others on the market. The price point is very comparable to others but might be cheaper on Target.com if you're purchasing a large $$ amount [...] friend of mine highly recommends a hands-free bustier for pumping & sends all of her NICU moms to purchase one from the gift shop in the hospital & all of the moms rave about it. So, that leads me to think that this item is going to be very invaluable in the future.",4
"I am happy with this hands free bra. I love that you can adjust to a different size. I also like that you can have the zipper either starting at the top or bottom. This one is definitely worth the money compared to others on the market.",4
"I am an exclusive pumper, so I use this bra a lot. It fits comfortably and has the option to include shoulder straps. My washer ate the zipper though :( Also, I believe the price is cheaper on Amazon than it is through Target.",4
"It was nice to have my hands free to read, snack or fold the laundry.",4
"The hands free pumping bra is prefect for the working mom. I am able to continue checking email or read documents while pumping. This makes it much easier to not skip a pumping session knowing I can still get things done.",4
"Does a great job of holding up heavy flanges + milk filled bottles. Completely hands free and no worries that it will slip or sag. For all day wear it is less than ideal, especially in warm climates. Also provides minimal support for your breasts.",4
"This product is a great help as I am exclusively pumping and appreciate being able to use my hands while pumping. It allows me to continue to work while at work or relax while pumping at home instead of holding my arms up for 20+ minutes every three hours.\n\nThe drawback is one size does not fit all in the width between breasts. I had to go to the Lansioch website to order an extra panel for the front before it worked properly. The panel was only $3 but it was a pain to have to make a second order and wait again for the shipment.",4
"I am really happy with my purchase. I wish these sizes are sold in stores, but that is the way things are. The bra sits in place , and adjustable for the perfect fit. I would recommend this bra to any mom.",4
"So the awesome thing about this bra is that it's expandable. It actually comes with two pieces so it can expand to the right size. On the down side, even at it's longest it is still feels a little tight for my 38B postpartum. \n\nIt works great to hold my pump flanges so I have hands free pumping and can take care of my baby while pumping (or whatever else I need to do). The fabric is nice and soft so it doesn't feel like it's ripping my skin off. I also like that it comes with optional straps that can be worn multiple ways or not at all.",4
"This bra works ok for a hands free pump. Not very comfortable to wear all day. This bra has extras from the medulla bra which ends up getting in the way. I do like the zipper change though.",4

"If you're like me, and not at all ready to slip into oversized, elastic maternity wear, then this could be just the thing. I'm now over 6 months pregnant and still using it. It's not a perfect solution, works better with some of my pants than others, but all in all, it's way better than using rubber bands and safety pins!",4
"I bought this when I was about 2 months pregnant to expand the life of my regular jeans, I loved the different sizes and different buttons and the different colors for every outfit, what I didn't love was the little piece you attached that is supposed to \",4
"I think this was a pretty neat invention and have found it useful. I'm not sure it will work later in pregnancy but we'll give it a good try. after reading another review, I too, am using it with the belly band.",4
"What a great idea for the beginning of a pregnancy. I showed right away and at 4 weeks couldn't button my pants. The Belly Belt Combo was a lifesaver. . .I had not problem wearing my own pants with these extenders and it's so much better than the old rubber band trick!",4
"I would give this 5 stars if the small piece of fabric that comes with the belts actually worked. I don't use the pieces of fabric at all - just the belt and I have had no problems. The belt has been very convienent and easy to use. The kit I purchased comes with two sizes (small and large) and with two types of fasteners. Two come with buttons and the others come with the slide type of fastener so it is nice for my work pants (all together 4 belts). I am 14 weeks along and still using the small belt and haven't needed to move up to the large belt. I have been able to keep wearing my pre-pregnancy pants and jeans without a problem. The only thing that I have to say is that the fabric pieces that come with the kit aren't very useable and bunch up when you sit and then stand back up. Instead I don't use it and wear longer blouses to cover my unzipped pants. This belt has been great. I recommend it to anyone.",4
"so far this is saving me from having to buy new clothes as i am too small for maternity but slightly outgrowing my current clothes size...this is definitely helping my very tight budget and hopefully allow me to hold off on a shopping spree!",4
"I was able to use the belly belt for the first 7 months of my pregnancy and didn't have to buy maternity pants! After 7 months, it was harder to hide the zipper part of my jeans without a longer shirt. Overall, great investment...for at least the first half of pregnancy.",4
"I love these leggings, now that I am in 3rd trimester.  The crotch area is huge and I am constantly pulling them up.  It is a little better now that Im in 3rd tri but still a problem.  They are super comfy, and I wear them all the time, I just can't wear them if I am going to be doing a lot of walking around, because then the drive me crazy.",4
"I find these leggings to be a nice thickness and very comfortable, much more than a few other brands I've purchased. I am 5 months along in my third pregnancy and they fit pretty well. I do agree with others that they tend to sag in the crotch area after awhile, but I think as my belly grows I can pull them up higher and won't have that problem. I got them on sale, so am happy with them!",4
"These are the most comfortable leggings I own! I will probably wear them when I'm not pregnant anymore. The only two improvements I would make is that when you bend over in the right light they can be a little see-through, so watch yourself and that they can get a little stretched out around the ankles, nothing a washing won't fix but sometimes I need to wear mine twice in one week :)",4
"These are very comfortable, and look great on. The only drawback is that I feel like they slide down. I'm only 13 weeks, so I might not have enough of a \",4
"The hands-free bra was a much needed relief for me. The bra really does hold the pumps in place and allows you to use your hands while you pump. I am a teacher, so when I went back to work I had to pump during my lunch and planning period. Once I had the bra, I could pump while I ate, and I could check email and grade papers during my planning. Now that I'm out for the summer, it's nice to have my hands free to read a magazine or take care of my infant. I have also washed it a couple of times and no damage was done. There are two reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5: A latch at the top of the zipper would be great to add extra security. Also, since I have only used it for a few weeks, I'm not sure how well it will hold up over time. I can see how the holes could eventually stretch out. However, even if it holds up for a few months, that would be worth it for me.",4
"You still have only the length of your tubing to get around so you can't go around doing chores, etc but it allows for you to do deskwork, read a book, even eat a meal while pumping and prevents wrist hand fatigue. Considering I pump every 3 hours/day, this has been one of the most used items in my household.I have two so if one gets stained with breastmilk, etc I have another one for backup.",4
"This is a great product for hands free pumping. The fit is very true to size and the design makes it very easy to put on.",4
"I received a size L from my registry.  I am still pregnant and a 38-40 D or DD and the L just barely fit me. Because there is no adjustable clasp, just a zipper in front, I knew I had to go online to buy the XL because if I go beyond a 40D when my milk comes in, and I definitely will, it won't zip up. It seems to be made well and came highly recommended from another mom.",4
"I thought that this size would be perfect for me and ordered it when my son was 3 weeks old. I was disappointed in the fit and had difficulty with the zipper, which split when I tried putting the garment on. I initially thought that this was a poor quality product, but then I realized that my boobs were actually growing with the increased feedings since my baby's birth. I ordered a size up (XL) and magically, the garment seemed like it was much sturdier. I use it daily now and it holds up well. When it fits and is on properly, it is very comfortable and makes the whole process less stressful for me. It has actually been very useful to my pumping routine, helping to keep the shields in place and extract more milk.",4
"The bustier has made it so much more convenient to pump, which I do exclusively. It is comfortable, but I would not wear it unless I am going to pump. You don't even have to remove your nursing bra to use. I don't.know if you could use a brand other than Medela with a Medela pump, it is somewhat pricey but the freedom is priceless.",4
"I almost exclusively pump and being attached to the pump every 3 hours, this is a must have. This frees up your hands to eat, work on the computer or hold the baby. I was a 34C pre-pregnancy and ordered a Medium. It is snug, but I think it should be to hold the pump parts in place correctly. I did get a small tear in the seam on the side, which I was disappointed in, but since I do use it 7 times a day, maybe it should be expected. I am going to buy a second one to keep at work while pumping. I would recommend going hands free.",4
"This is the only pumping bustier I could even find at Target, and I still had to go out of my way to pick it up, only to find the size I should have been was too tight. I went to a different Target to exchange for the next size up, and it is still a bit too tight, but not so much that it is more than mildly annoying to put on.",4
"This works well until you produce a lot of milk which causes the suction cup to pull away from the breast and lose suction.",4
"I was just on the boarder between sizes and went with the larger size - glad I did because it is still super tight - I couldn't even have zipped up the medium!\n\nAlso, while this makes it possible to pump hands free, if you have the all in one breast shield set up (where the shields are not separate from the valve/membrane piece) it's a little more cumbersome to get it set up. Just be forewarned.",4
"Pros:\n- hands are free to cook, email, etc while I pump\n- soft, washable, stretchy fabric\n\nCons:\n- difficult to put on since you have to keep the zipper snug to zip it up\n- zipper sometimes fails\n\nBottom Line: I would DEFINITELY recommend this product to any mom that's pumping!",4
"I really liked this, even though it was a little difficult to zip up. Maybe that's just because I'm a bigger gal, but I had a hard time getting it around me and then holding it in place to put the zipper end in, then pull it up without the zipper flying apart again.",4
"This makes it so much easier to pump! I can get other things accomplished! Before I bought this, I was stuck sitting there watching the world go by while pumping, now I can do things other than watch television while pumping!",4
"Glad that I bought this item. As suggested by some reviews I got one size up from what was shown for me in the sizing guide. It's still very tight, but that's because it's supposed to be. It does give me a slight backache because of the constriction, but only really when I slouch. I tuck the motor part into the back of my pants when I need to get walk around or get some stuff done while pumping, which makes it SUPER convenient. So far, pumping 6-8 times per day, I have not had any issues with the zipper, though I can see how it could easily break.",4
"It's been a week since I gave birth and I finally got one of these. I bought one prior to giving birth, but it was too small and when I went to return it, they didn't have the larger size available. I really like the product, but I hate the Zipper! I wish they would have made it with buttons or hooks. My zipper is stuck, so I had to pull it over my head to use it. Other than that, it's a great product!",4
"Runs small. Current bra size is 36 C so I ordered the medium. It's a little snug, but I think it helps hold everything in place. I wish it had snaps or Velcro instead of a zipper as it is frustrating to zip up sometimes. I found it easier to put the bra on, zip it up, and then put the pumps through the holes. Sometimes you still have to hold pump for suction/positioning, but it's better than nothing!",4
"Seems like after the first time I used it it stretched out so I need to wear another nursing bra under it so it's not constantly falling while I pump.  I ordered the size it said I should have but wish I would have ordered a smaller one.  Seems a little over priced for what it is but all Medela products seem to be that way.",4
"I would recommend this to everyone who has to pump.  I pumped for a few weeks without using one and it was a pain to hold the bottles and not being able to use my hands.  The bustier fits a little tight, but it is not uncomfortable.",4
"Great cami, but runs very big!",4
"Fit well but does not have adjustable straps!",4
"Don't waste money buying the Medela one. This one fits much better as it is adjustable.",4
"This bra has been so helpful for pumping at work. I don't know what I would do without it. I like that the size is adjustable, so it can fit anyone..",4
"As I'm in my final trimester, I have yet to use this bustier. However, I have been comparing it to others that I have seen & can honestly say that this one appears to be much better constructed than others on the market. The price point is very comparable to others but might be cheaper on Target.com if you're purchasing a large $$ amount [...] friend of mine highly recommends a hands-free bustier for pumping & sends all of her NICU moms to purchase one from the gift shop in the hospital & all of the moms rave about it. So, that leads me to think that this item is going to be very invaluable in the future.",4
"I am happy with this hands free bra. I love that you can adjust to a different size. I also like that you can have the zipper either starting at the top or bottom. This one is definitely worth the money compared to others on the market.",4
"I am an exclusive pumper, so I use this bra a lot. It fits comfortably and has the option to include shoulder straps. My washer ate the zipper though :( Also, I believe the price is cheaper on Amazon than it is through Target.",4
"It was nice to have my hands free to read, snack or fold the laundry.",4
"The hands free pumping bra is prefect for the working mom. I am able to continue checking email or read documents while pumping. This makes it much easier to not skip a pumping session knowing I can still get things done.",4
"Does a great job of holding up heavy flanges + milk filled bottles. Completely hands free and no worries that it will slip or sag. For all day wear it is less than ideal, especially in warm climates. Also provides minimal support for your breasts.",4
"This product is a great help as I am exclusively pumping and appreciate being able to use my hands while pumping. It allows me to continue to work while at work or relax while pumping at home instead of holding my arms up for 20+ minutes every three hours.\n\nThe drawback is one size does not fit all in the width between breasts. I had to go to the Lansioch website to order an extra panel for the front before it worked properly. The panel was only $3 but it was a pain to have to make a second order and wait again for the shipment.",4
"I am really happy with my purchase. I wish these sizes are sold in stores, but that is the way things are. The bra sits in place , and adjustable for the perfect fit. I would recommend this bra to any mom.",4
"So the awesome thing about this bra is that it's expandable. It actually comes with two pieces so it can expand to the right size. On the down side, even at it's longest it is still feels a little tight for my 38B postpartum. \n\nIt works great to hold my pump flanges so I have hands free pumping and can take care of my baby while pumping (or whatever else I need to do). The fabric is nice and soft so it doesn't feel like it's ripping my skin off. I also like that it comes with optional straps that can be worn multiple ways or not at all.",4

"I bought my belly bandit prior to my c section delivery in hopes of bouncing back to my pre-pregnancy body since I've always had an athletic build. I was a size 1 before pregnancy and so I purchased an XS. I disappointed when I tried to wear it 4 days postpartum and it wouldn't even close! I even filled out a return slip but tried it 2 days later out of curiousity and it barely closed so I kept it. All if sudden I began to shrink and at 2 weeks postpartum it isn't as tight as I need it. I loved the support it provided to my weak core and I definitely think it helped to shrink my waist but I had to dock it a star on my rating because I feel like now I need an XXS and there isn't one available.",4

"I'm only on my fourth day of wearing the Original Belly Bandit, but I love this thing! I'm not sure if it's helping me get down to my pre pregnant belly size any faster (this is my first baby), but it's crazy how much more comfortable I feel when I wear it. It just holds everything in place for me while I try to care for my newborn and do things around the house. Only complaint is that it's not all that conspicuous under clothes, but I'm not really going anywhere in anything but tshirts right now anyway. I recommend the Belly Bandit to any of my pregnant friends.",4
"I used my belly bandit after having my baby boy. I liked how it held everything in place. It was a little uncomfortable at first and the velcro was a little bulky so I had to wear baggy clothes so it wouldn't be noticeable that I was wearing one.... but my belly shrank down in size pretty fast so I'm glad I bought one. I probably should have bought two because it wasn't long before I needed a smaller size.",4

"I bought this bra because I needed something to hold nursing pads at night before my baby was even born.

I bought a large and an x-large. I was a 34B before, now I'm a 36D. The large fits great and I'm hoping the x-large will work when my milk comes in (although it fits now too).

"I bought this dress for New Years Eve. Thankfully, I ordered about a month early, because I have had to send this dress back twice to size down. I am not a small girl; I usually wear an 18-20/2X, and tend to buy a 20 in all dresses that I wear. That being said, I initially purchased this dress in a 20, and when it arrived at my house and I tried it on, it was ridiculously large. It looked really baggy and boxy in the chest area (not a normal thing for me to experience with 44Ds), and the due to it being so large, the dress was just kind of.... there. It had no shape or life to it at all.\nI returned the dress and sized down to an 18. When the second dress arrived, I tried it on, and it was still pretty baggy. The shape had improved, and it was a lot more flattering than the 20 had been, but it was definitely still too large.\nI ultimately ended up fitting nicely into a size 16, and am absolutely in love with the way this dress looks with a red shoe and a red lip.\n\nMoral of the story: If you plan to purchase this dress, plan to size down at least one size.",4

"Shirts runs a little small, but overall, a very good tee shirt. I bought a XXL, and could have used a 3XL in this shirt. But I kept it because I love the color.",4

"This is a very thin waffle knit that I found in the store. What was unusual is that some of the colors had a softer feel to the fabric. The gorgeous Sea Ship blue one, for instance, was very scratchy and the neckline looked a little uneven. The olive, the gray, and the maroon (really a lavenderish purple) were all very soft. I didn't touch all of the colors - sorry! I purchased this in the olive (Woody Green) in the store, and ordered the maroon one online. The color swatches and the names are not matching up right on here!",4

"I like this shirt. It is long enough to wear with leggings and has a loose but flattering fit.The only thing is that the material (cotton-ish) is a little heavier than expected and a little scratchy. It is totally fine with a fitted tank underneath, but itchy on its own (even after several washes)",4

Would prefer all cotton, but this fills a hole in my wardrobe right now.",4

I was a little apprehensive about the size, since usually 2s in the Womens section don't always actually fit me, but this one did and I'm so glad I took a chance! The zipper is functional, by the way, so you can zip up or down how much you want. Cute skirt.",4

However, they do bag out quite a bit as the day wears on.\n\nThis is my first pair of Merona pants and I think the 2 fit more like a 4 in other brands.",4
"This skirt is comfortable and fits perfect! I didn't give 5 stars because as the other review says, the description says pockets, and there are none. But I don't mind that much. I wore it to a business meeting the day after it came in the mail! I just wish it was available in stores for easier purchasing.",4
"Fits true to size...",4
"Overall this shirt is great! It is a little narrow around the hips and butt. So if you are a little curvy I suggest you go up one size",4
"Please size up because its not vanity sizing at all here ladies. I'm a 4 and the small was pretty small, i could fit in it, but not comfortably.",4
"The dress has a rigid a-line structure (which I find nice), and the medium weight material is appropriate for cooler nights. The color and material look more elegant in person than in the picture.

I bought them after trying them on, knowing that I will exclusively be able to wear them with a long top. They are pretty high waist, which accentuates the hips, and the elastic is pretty thin. These would have been much more flattering with a lower waist and 3/4 inches band.\nObviously disregard if you're skinny with a perfectly flat stomach...",4

I kind of like my colors to be spot on, so not sure if I'll keep it or not. (It's on a deeper clearance in the stores right now, so I may not be the only one bugged by this).",4
"This is a cute green cardigan. I ordered my normal size online and think it runs a tiny bit small and the arms are pretty tight. Also, the knit doesn't have much stretch to it at all so the arms didn't loosen up much at all during the day like you might expect. I should point out that the black pattern you see on the sweater is actually part of the sweater. For some reason I thought it the knit on the sweater was loose and the black you could see was the shirt the model has on underneath. I still like it though.",4

"This looks adorable over a maxi dress or with a tank top where you want a little bit more coverage. I do feel like it runs a little small but I expected that since it's juniors. I worry that the fringe will not do well in the wash so I plan on putting it in a mesh bag when I wash it.",4
"I just bought this jacket and it is really great for the price. I actually like the fact that the faux shearling is only on the collar and not the entire lining, which adds warmth, but too much bulk. My only complaint is the sizing. I am always, no matter what brand or store, a size medium in a denim jacket. The arms were way too tight. I had to size up to a large for the arms and shoulders, so now the waist is too loose. The distressing is really nice, so I am definitely keeping it.",4

It is not as long as the picture shows and as another reviewer noticed, but thats ok it sits and just below the waist and looks and fits super (kinda like old school). It is more of a shirt than a sweatshirt.not as thick as a sweatshirt, but like a soft stretchy LS shirt. like it!",4
"I'm tall so I am always looking for longer tops. This one was nicer than others because it isn't an extremely thick material.",4

"This is super soft and cozy. It runs a bit small, especially in the arms. I have worn it once and noticed that the fleece was quickly matted down by the seatbelt in my car, so I'm anxious to see how it holds up long term.

Come on, families sometimes like to match!\nAnyway, this shirt is comfy but definitely listen to the reviewers that went up. curvy shaped Mediums should by an XL and less curvy could do a Large.",4
"nice material...looks good on...",4
"Smooth and easy. Put it on. Looks nice. A small touch to cover back and shoulders for an off the shoulders dress with solid black lace.",4
"I really liked this item since it is different from so many other tunics available. Perfect length to wear with leggings. The fabric is different and really makes this one so very cool - the body of the tunic is different than the arms which can be rolled up to show a contrasting different color. I am generally between an XS and a small and decided to order the XS - now I wish I'd gone with the small. Since the fabric is kind of quilted, it doesn't really drape and it doesn't have as much stretch as a simple knit. Since I tend to be smaller on top with broader hips, this is a bit too stiff to follow the curves of my body - too large on top, just a hair to snug in the hips to let it shift as it needs. Sending it back - but probably reordering the small.",4
"I really like the cut of these tops. Rather than just a straight shirt it has a seam around it giving it a different dimension. They are thick and feel great on cool days. They do run small so I would go up a size or two..according to how you like a fit. Great colors too.",4
"Love the look. Hand washed and let hang dry- the shirt shrunk one inch. Returned for a large- hope this one shrinks too, it's too big right now.",4
"I do not like the neck line. I am busty and a boxy neck line just doesn't work for me. I wore it with a scarf, and it was great!",4

"Love this shirt. Thinking about getting another one for if and when this one has been worn and washed too many times. Have had lots of compliments on it. Great for casual wear or cute top for the gym.",4

My only complaint is that the bottoms are much bigger then the top. The top fits me perfectly and is slighly baggy but the shorts just barley stay on me (I'm 5'4 and 130 pounds and got a size medium). The waist band is elastic and doesn't stretch out at all when I'm wearing them. I have washed the pajamas several times and there hasn't been any shrinkage or color fading. A most have for any Adventure Time fans.",4

"I ordered this robe about 2 weeks ago and it's exactly what I wanted. Warm but not too heavy and it washes like a dream. I wish the wrap around tie was just a bit longer, but it's OK. Love the color too.",4
"I liked it. I planned on pairing with leggings and wearing as a shirt but its a bit too long in the back to do this. ALSO If your skinnyish but have muscley arms youll have to size up because the XS fit me except I couldin't move my arms cause I have sort of muscley upper arms. im 5'4 about 130 lbs fit-ish...",4
"I got this item hoping for something that is comfortable to sleep in, while also being pretty. The first thing I noticed was that the fabric on this chemise gown is incredibly soft. The gown also hangs just right so that it isn't too tight, which could make it uncomfortable to sleep in. The cut of the gown is flattering and the adjustable straps are a really nice feature! Overall a great product!",4
"cute print and soft fabric...perfect for summer. i sized up in this as i like loose sleepwear",4
"This feels wonderful on. I'm concerned the material won't wash well but it's looks and feels soft and stretchy out of the package...a little thin.",4

"I was quite surprised at the styling & versatility of these Modal Lounge Pants!! I am 5'9 w/a 33.5 in. inseam, 235lbs, size 18/20 & somewhat curvy. I ordered the LONG XXL and I'm so glad that I did because the length was perfect!!! The pants are quite long though, but I usually roll the waistline up then tie to bring up the legnth when wearing flats or walking shoes/gym shoes or I just tie them at my regular waistline when wearing high heeled booties or dress boots. Super versatile for styling as well, can wear as casual pants or dressy pants & no one knows that they are Loungewear!!\n\nThese pants are very thin but do not show bumps or bulges easily because the material is so substantially roomy and the pants legs are a wide flareleg style. I would definitely wear these in Spring & Summer weather but if U really want to wear these in the Fall & Winter months, put on some leggings underneath to keep you warm.\n\nBased on the legnth of the LONG pants, I can see anyone with up to a 36 in. inseam rockin' these lounge pants, NO PROBLEM! Bought on sale, buy one, get 60% off another pair + use an 20% promo on my order...made these pants a STEAL!! The Black & Brown pair look nice & dressy, the Gray pair has a more casual Heather Gray look (for walking/working out) and the Navy is more Blue than a dark Navy Blue. They wash quite well...I've already washed them in warm & hot water + thrown them in the dryer on high heat and they haven't shrunk yet!\n\nGreat buy, especially if you can get them on sale!! These are some really comfortable, versatile lounge pants! I gave 4stars though because they are pretty thin & light but a good buy none the less!",4
"Couldn't resist this nightgown however it runs REALLY small. Size up!",4
"I love these pajamas and bought them in three colors. They are really soft, stretchy, and comfortable. They kind of lose their shape after being washed a few times, mostly in the collar area. I also noticed that the shirt on this gray set is a little shorter than the shirts on the black and pink sets (FYI, the pink set is a little sheer). But I bought all three because they're so cute and comfortable.",4
"Most comfy sleep pants I have ever had. I do recommend buying at least one size smaller because they run big and are very stretchy.",4

"Loved these pajamas, very comfortable. I love the tank top lettering! The only thing I assume because I'm a little curvier than the model is the shorts barely covered my bum, but everything fit. Just something to keep in mind.",4

They have pants pockets which are fairly small, they are basically the size of my fist might be a problem for someone who wants more pocket this however doesn't pertain to me because I don't care about pockets, you also have a tiny pocket on the left breast. The waistband is kind of small but it strenches well without feeling restraining for me it also comes with a red silk ribbon tie.\n\nAs soon as I got home I washed them alone in cold water and had no bleeding of the red dye.

The fitting around my bum and thighs are perfect for me it's form fitting without hugging every little curve but still loose fitting. My other problem was that the top didn't to match size wise, like the length of the pants are long and the length of the sleeves are short on me. The sleeves barely touch my wrists. The fitting around the torso is a comfortable form fitting, but the perfect looseness without that box like look that most pj sets of this kind give you.\n\nThese are obviously Christmas pjs and when the holiday is over they will be packed up with everything Christmas until next year so these aren't everyday all year long pjs for me.\n\nSo with that being said if you are buying them try on in store and keep in mind they will shrink but if you wash cold",4
"First off, when I opened my package I was so happy to feel the plushy softness of these robes! They feel so comfy and squishy to the touch. BUT my delight was somewhat short-lived as I was quickly disappointed to see that the inside is not fleecey. It's still soft, but the inside isn't lined with the same fleece as the outside. Also inside of the red/black is not very nice-looking. You can see from the picture the faded red/black pattern. I wish the pattern and the fleecey material was through and through. There was such potential! Alas.",4

"I got this item hoping for something that is comfortable to sleep in, while also being pretty. The first thing I noticed was that the fabric on this chemise gown is incredibly soft. The gown also hangs just right so that it isn't too tight, which could make it uncomfortable to sleep in. The cut of the gown is flattering and the adjustable straps are a really nice feature! Overall a great product!",4

"I was quite surprised at the styling & versatility of these Modal Lounge Pants!! I am 5'9 w/a 33.5 in. inseam, 235lbs, size 18/20 & somewhat curvy. I ordered the LONG XXL and I'm so glad that I did because the length was perfect!!! The pants are quite long though, but I usually roll the waistline up then tie to bring up the legnth when wearing flats or walking shoes/gym shoes or I just tie them at my regular waistline when wearing high heeled booties or dress boots. Super versatile for styling as well, can wear as casual pants or dressy pants & no one knows that they are Loungewear!!\n\nThese pants are very thin but do not show bumps or bulges easily because the material is so substantially roomy and the pants legs are a wide flareleg style. I would definitely wear these in Spring & Summer weather but if U really want to wear these in the Fall & Winter months, put on some leggings underneath to keep you warm.\n\nBased on the legnth of the LONG pants, I can see anyone with up to a 36 in. inseam rockin' these lounge pants, NO PROBLEM! Bought on sale, buy one, get 60% off another pair + use an 20% promo on my order...made these pants a STEAL!! The Black & Brown pair look nice & dressy, the Gray pair has a more casual Heather Gray look (for walking/working out) and the Navy is more Blue than a dark Navy Blue. They wash quite well...I've already washed them in warm & hot water + thrown them in the dryer on high heat and they haven't shrunk yet!\n\nGreat buy, especially if you can get them on sale!! These are some really comfortable, versatile lounge pants! I gave 4stars though because they are pretty thin & light but a good buy none the less!",4
"Couldn't resist this nightgown however it runs REALLY small. Size up!",4
"I love these pajamas and bought them in three colors. They are really soft, stretchy, and comfortable. They kind of lose their shape after being washed a few times, mostly in the collar area. I also noticed that the shirt on this gray set is a little shorter than the shirts on the black and pink sets (FYI, the pink set is a little sheer). But I bought all three because they're so cute and comfortable.",4
"Most comfy sleep pants I have ever had. I do recommend buying at least one size smaller because they run big and are very stretchy.",4

"I bought this expecting it to be a more poodle-like faux fur texture, but when it arrived, it was more similar to faux sheepskin on the outside. It's very soft to the touch and I got several compliments when I wore it out for the first time. The inner lining is just one layer of polyester fabric, so this is definitely not a cold weather coat, but for a night out, this does jazz up an outfit if you won't be outside for very long. I followed the size chart and bought an XL, since I am size 14 and have a 40C bust. The XL fits me well, but is a tiny bit narrow in the shoulders- I do not have wide shoulders at all, so if you are broad-shouldered, you'll definitely want to go up a size. I'm keeping this one for fun special occasions, but if you want to wear daily, note that this is dry clean only.",4
"This is great to throw on over a maxi dress or tank top to add a little coverage for work. It goes with everything and is really cute with leggings.

"This is a very stylish, flattering pair of jeans at an affordable price. I bought a pair last month, and am contemplating going back for a second. They are comfortable, and hold their shape better than most stretch jeans.",4
"I love the dark color and contrast stitching on these jeans but the color did rub off on my white boots, so these need to be pre-washed to get the extra ink out. Good news is that they remained true to fit and color after a hot wash and heat dry, so they are minimal maintenance. Bootcut is back so these are a really comfortable pair that you can wear all day without feeling the pinch. Recommend to anyone trying to stay in style without breaking the bank!",4
"I received a free sample of Blue Bootcut Modern Fit Jeans. These jeans very are soft, not stiff almost a thin material if you will which makes then feel like they have been broken in for years. The proportion is terrific as well. I have paid a high price for other similar boot cut jeans and these are much more comfortable.\nThese are classy and can go from evening looking sharp.\nIf I had to change anything, personally I would like the back pockets 1/2 to an inch higher.",4
"I really like the fit and style of these jeans. That being said the color comes off after more than one washing. The pair I have on now have been washed at least five times now. I was scratching my leg and the color actually came off on my fingers. It also stained the tops of my sneakers. Also, these jeans seems to attract anything they are near like lint or pet fur. With other jeans I've been able to just brush off the fur if the cat happens to wring around my leg. I know this is just the regular peril of having pets but I've never noticed this problem with any other jeans I've owned.",4
"I liked this product a lot!!!",4
"My number one complaint with jeans is how much stretch they have. You can't even go a few hours before it looks like you're wearing pants 2 sizes too big. It's not flattering. I bought these and haven't had that problem since! I only wish they offered more washes, so I could have a few pairs in the styles I love.",4
"I'm very curvy and worried these might not be flattering.  However the stretch, color and cut of these are very slimming!  Even though I am 5'7\",4
"These are fabulous... Comfortable..fit perfectly (I'm short and well, have let's say an abundance of posterior). The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the denim material was a little heavier. But they are very soft and everything falls in the right place. Will buy another pair .. or 2...or 3...",4
"I love these jeans. The only thing that disappointed me was that the jeans are so much more darker than the picture... the darkest blue jeans can get. Hopefully they'll get some light (really light) colored jeans in soon.",4
"Quality jeans.  Fit true to size.  Stretching is nice and comfy.",4
"They are very comfortable pants!",4

"I sit on the floor to work with kids most of the day, so I am consantly bending, stretching, etc. I needed a pair of jeans that were stretchy, not too low rise, and comfortable and these fit the bill. The material is thin and very very stretchy, so it's perfect for my uses. I probably wouldn't do any really rough activities in these due to the thin material. The dark wash gives them a more professional look, which is nice to wear with collared shirts. The rise in the back is modest enough for bending at work. I bought the \",4
"Quality jeans.  Fit true to size.  Stretching is nice and comfy.",4
"I really like how soft and stretchy these are. Very comfortable. They do have to be pulled up each time I stand up, but I don't have any jeans that I don't have to do that to. I would recommend for their comfort.",4
"they fit perfect around waist but length is to long but i love the stetch fit they give me",4
"I love the fit and comfort of these jeans. I'm 5'8 and bought the 10L. Although they are longer, would love a little longer for the higher heels....but can't complain about anything else. I did try these on in the store and found I needed a size smaller than expected. Highly recommend for the comfort and feel.",4
"Gave the quality a average because I noticed a snag or two on the back of my daughters jeans but she is pretty rough on clothes. Not really a \",4
"The color is great but it's a shame that the length can't be more customizable. These are super long even in heels!",4
"I ordered these jeans in my normal size and due to the stretch of the jean I ordered another in a size down. These are super long by about three inches but the top high waist is awesome.",4
"I had been looking all over the internet for matalic, gold jeggings. I found a lot out there. Most affordable ones, look like tensile or stretched foil. They had no resemblance of jeans. They were too costumi. Some of them were much more exspensive than the ones that I bought. They note like tights or cheap leggings. The more high-end ones were over the top expensive and some didn't look as good the costumi ones. These look like jeans. They are of quality material. They feel good to touch. You can dress them up or down. I like them more than I imagined that I would have. I am so please that they weren't as gold in color as I was looking for. The picture doesn't do them justice. I couldn't believe how well made they are for the price. I am pleased. This item gets a 4 star, only because I haven't worn them yet. I am looking forward to it.",4
"i love the fit of these jegging and the color butttt they are not really mid rise they fit kinda low and loose from the waist.",4
"These would pretty much be perfect if the front pockets were real. A good amount of stretch, but enough structure to be on the jeans side of jeggings. Back pockets are real, so they'll stay in the rotation.",4
"I love these jeggings. They are really comfortable and have held up great after months of wear. I've lost a little weight so they are starting to get loose and I might buy a smaller size. My only complaint is that the color is kind of warm, I'd like it better if it was a more neutral tone but it's fine. I'm 5'4 and the short inseam is perfect.",4
"Finding jeans that fit well can be tough! I was pleasantly surprised by how well this pair fits, especially through the hips and the waist. The stretch is great and - oh my goodness - are they soft! I really like the wash too.",4
"I'm 5'5 and these stop at my ankles. They feel quite comfortable and the wash is not too cheesy or cheap looking. I would say they are true to size.",4
"Happy to find a 00 fit is better than the 0 but still a bit large especially in the hip and thighs. Wish they were at least 30\",4
"I received a free sample of these jeans to try in exchange for a review. I will say at first I was skeptical because I am not a fan of colored jeans, but I absolutely would wear these jeans. They have the ability to be dressed up or dressed down. They are stretchy, but not in a way that will loosen over time. They fit all of my curves and are perfect for a little extra room in the booty area. I have a smaller waist and larger backside, so I always have a problem with them fitting in one place but not the other. This is not the case with these jeans. The only problem I have with these jeans is that they are a little too long for me. I am on the shorter side (5` 3`), so I tend to buy petite in my skinny jeans because of the length. I have just been rolling them up a little and wearing them with flats though. However, they wash well and are worth the buy. I would recommend these to anyone!",4
"I received a free sample of these jeans in exchange for agreeing to write a review. I really like the softness of the material, they were very comfortable! They fit very nicely after upon putting them one, but after wearing them for eight hours they were baggy in the butt and upper thigh. After I washed them they fit great again, but loosed too much by the end of the day. I might try going one size smaller to accomodate the stretching.",4
"These jeans are great quality. The Modern Fit fits perfectly through the hips and thighs, however, the skinny jeans were very tight through the calf. Material is very soft and perfect weight so they are more comfortable to wear all day long. I like the fact that they come in a dark color or a lighter jean color. I'm 5'8"" and often have trouble with not enough length but these are ample so after a few washings they will be perfect. I did receive these jeans as a sample to write a review. I will have to try out other Lee jeans at Target!",4
"I purchased a size 4L, which fit comparably to most pants that are of the same size. I wish the mid-rise was sitting slightly higher because my hips do stick out and they rub into my hips a bit. I was a bit worried that the calf part would be too tight for me because my calves are on the larger size and with skinny pants that is sometimes the case, but it was fine.\n\nThey are VERY soft and do not feel like true jeans whatsoever. Because of that, they get very wrinkly very quickly. Other than that, they feel great.",4
"Ordered a size bigger just because you never know with skinnys, but could have ordered regular size. Very stretchy, good color, inseam is a little shorter than I like. Overall good fit and quality for the price.",4
"Great color. Comfortable to sit in. My husband washed them on the WRONG temperature cycle and they and they didn't shrink up to short. They are still long enough to wear.",4

"The jeans were fine after I lengthened the pockets. I added about 4 inches so I could carry my wallet. They could have also been longer as they barely hit the top of my ankle.",4
"These jeans are my favorite!  However, I would suggest trying EACH pair on.  They don't all fit the same.  I bought one pair, same size I always buy (2M), and they were falling off of me!  I took them back and the next pair is a bit snug!  Luckily, Target accepts clothing when you have cut the tags off.",4

So we were thrilled to find we could still get them online.\n\nThey fit great, true to size and they are very versatile. I will be washing them a little more gently and maybe avoid the dryer every other time, in hopes that they last a little longer this time.",4
"These did not fit well on me at all - I ordered a size up from my usual after having a baby, but i feel like the fit would be better in a size down. For example: if you wear a size 10 in the modern fit, buy a size 8 in these. I returned them. If you've got a bigger booty, these might be more comfortable or accurate.",4
"Like them, but they do run a tad small. I think once I wear them they will have a little more \",4
"These jeans are great! They fit perfectly, sit at the right place on my hips and the width of the pants is just right. Material is very soft and perfect weight so they are more comfortable to wear all day long. I like the fact that they come in a dark color or a lighter jean color. I'm 5'8"" and often have trouble with not enough length but these are ample so after a few washings they will be perfect. The straight leg was very modern and stylish. However, the color blue of them was not to my liking. Not dark, and not light, almost like a cornflower blue. I did receive these jeans as a sample to write this review. That being said, I will considering purchasing additional jeans from Target in the future. The price is definitely right!",4
"These jeans are extremely similar to the sweetheart cut of another brand I like. These jeans feel like your favorite go to jean. They are somewhat worn looking in color. Great weekend jeans, comfortable as if I am wearing sweats, which is my favorite part of these jeans.\nI like pocket a tad bit higher other than that would change nothing.",4
"Unlike another review, I found the color to be black. I washed mine separately to ensure the color did not bleed and I had no problems with that after one wash. The rise is good and sits at my hips but they do fall down and I find myself pulling them up a lot.They are a little too big though and stretch out easily around the waist which is really annoying but, for the price not surprising. I would buy another pair but one size smaller. They also do collect hair and fuzzies easily. But, overall, I think they a good value.",4
"I've looked all over for a pair of black denim jeans that are long enough for me and Target had them. If you can get over the stinky dye smell that disappears after a few launders, you can't go wrong with these jeans",4
"The fit on these jeans is relaxed, which is nice and I feel like they fit true to size. The length is just a tad bit short, not enough to order the pants in 'long' but just enough to notice that they creep up. The denim is pretty light weight and generally comfortable. I like that the waist is a little bit lower than the natural waist, but higher than the hips to give you a decent amount of tummy coverage.",4

"I love these. I have two pairs. Super comfy, great for under dresses and tunics and even just lounging around the house. HOWEVER. If you have any kind of junk in your trunk, even if you DON'T bend over, these things are pretty sheer. I made the mistake of wearing dark undies with white polka dots and you can totally see them through the leggings! Extra proof why leggings should not, in general, be used as pants. Cover up the tush and you'll be just fine.",4
"Shipped pretty fast. They're a nice sort of soft/silky material...not completely sheer, but you certainly wouldn't be able to wear them as pants like the model up there^^^ don't be fooled ;)\nI'd say they're pretty true to size. I wear a size 16 and bought the XXL and they fit great.",4

"I am a size 14. I originally purchased these in size xl. I had to return because these seem to run about 2 sizes too small. I had to purchase again in a size 2xl. Other than running too small, these are great quality.",4
"These pants are nice and in a neutral color which is very versatile. The price is definitely fair for quality.\nKnow that the style is completely unforgiving around your waist and hips. I bought them after trying them on, knowing that I will exclusively be able to wear them with a long top. They are pretty high waist, which accentuates the hips, and the elastic is pretty thin. These would have been much more flattering with a lower waist and 3/4 inches band.\nObviously disregard if you're skinny with a perfectly flat stomach...",4
"I'm a stay at home mom of two, and I wear this type of yoga pants just about every day. They are very comfortable and look cute. I also like the boot-cut style. Some other pairs I've bought from different stores end up being too short, but these are just the right length for me at 5'4\",4

"I really like these pants, but the elastic/drawstring in the waist twists and flips so I have to fix it every time I put the pants on. A minor annoyance; I would still recommend these jogger pants to any Star Wars fan. Size XXL fits great (like a size 16).",4
"These pants are very cute and comfortable. I love them. They are lightweight material, however, so take that into account. These are not heavy pants that will keep you warm in the winter. Also, I would suggest laundering on delicate since the fabric is thin. For me they are true to size.",4
"I just bought these online because my mom and I saw a size Large in stores and she said it didn't quite fit. So I got a size X-Large for Christmas. She doesn't know this but hopefully she'll still love them :) Otherwise yes, the fabric is thin and I would read the tag before washing them.",4

However, they do bag out quite a bit as the day wears on.\n\nThis is my first pair of Merona pants and I think the 2 fit more like a 4 in other brands.",4
"These are definitely more \",4

They run kinda big so it depends on how you like it I like my clothing more fitted.",4
"Soft, supportive, and comfortable under exercise clothing. Wear these under running leggings in cool weather. They don't chafe and they breathe well.",4
"Whether I am bike riding or doing stuff around the house, these are my new go to pants. I expected them to be slightly longer based on the picture, but I was prepared for the 'just past the knee' length by the name. They have the perfect amount of stretch and help hold everything in!",4
"I love these workout capris. \ntrue to size",4
"Good work out pant but otherwise not a pair I would feel ok running about town in. More like a weird bermuda length then a knee pant. Fit is fine, definitely not super clingy (which is gross in anyone over a size 2). Look great with a C9 tank but not something I am comfortable wearing to target :}...a little too bare for me.",4
"I tried these pants on in the store in my normal size of an XL. XL in this brand is usually a little big on me which is the way I like it. These pants are marked slim fit. They are really more like leggings. I decide to purchase a size up. My local store did not have anymore in stock in larger sizes so I bought them on line. The XX has a little bit more room. I bought these for cycling in the winter. I wore them once already. They kept me very warm. They're soft and comfortable. I wish they'd go back to their old sizing. I have many C9 pants in XL are that are huge on me. This is second more recent C9 item that I've had to purchase in a larger size even though I've actually lost weight. It's kind of annoying. The pants seemed to have loosened a little after wearing them once. I haven't washed them yet. I hope they hold up. The quality seems to be good. Overall, I give them 4 stars. It was exactly what I was looking for. They would get 5 stars if the sizing was better.",4

I never received the turquoise/mint green and Target refunded my money. They do give me wedgies(lol) but are way more comfortable then regular panties would be in my opinion. I purchased the xxl. They fit pretty good other than the wedgies and they ride up a little on the thigh. For a full day at work they were just what I needed. They are very light weight so you keep cool. I do have a hole in the pantyliner area I'm not if this from. They did not seem too tight when I put them on. It be from washing them. All in all it filled the requirements I needed them for.",4

"I'm a full figured woman. I have full hips, thighs and a buttocks. I was looking for a comfortable undergarment for the summer that I could wear under my maxi dresses or short dresses. I found these shorts to do the job. I had purchased a pair similar to these several years ago and could not seem to find them anywhere. I came across these in a Target store just by accident. I wanted to buy more but no of the stores seem to carry them. I purchased them online. I bought an additional black pair, the pink/grey and the turquoise/mint green. I never received the turquoise/mint green and Target refunded my money. They do give me wedgies(lol) but are way more comfortable then regular panties would be in my opinion. I purchased the xxl. They fit pretty good other than the wedgies and they ride up a little on the thigh. For a full day at work they were just what I needed. They are very light weight so you keep cool. I do have a hole in the pantyliner area I'm not if this from. They did not seem too tight when I put them on. It be from washing them. All in all it filled the requirements I needed them for.",4
"I tried these pants on in the store in my normal size of an XL. XL in this brand is usually a little big on me which is the way I like it. These pants are marked slim fit. They are really more like leggings. I decide to purchase a size up. My local store did not have anymore in stock in larger sizes so I bought them on line. The XX has a little bit more room. I bought these for cycling in the winter. I wore them once already. They kept me very warm. They're soft and comfortable. I wish they'd go back to their old sizing. I have many C9 pants in XL are that are huge on me. This is second more recent C9 item that I've had to purchase in a larger size even though I've actually lost weight. It's kind of annoying. The pants seemed to have loosened a little after wearing them once. I haven't washed them yet. I hope they hold up. The quality seems to be good. Overall, I give them 4 stars. It was exactly what I was looking for. They would get 5 stars if the sizing was better.",4
"I was looking for sports bras that are comfortable to hang around the house in. These are good for that! The model is wearing two sports bras in the picture at one time. I am a 36DD and purchased these in an XL. They don't offer much support but I wasn't expecting them to. They are comfortable where you don't feel like you're wearing a bra at all!",4

"Love these sock, just wish that they had more of a selection in size 8 to 12 in the stores and on line. Also, need black in the larger colors.",4
"Don't expect them to be magical, but they stay up on your calf throughout the day and keep shape/color for a good amount of time. They aren't uncomfortable either. More of a spring/summer sock than a fall/winter.",4
"I really like these for the type. I haven't worn this type for many years. I usually wear only white cotton crew socks. Decided to change things up a bit. These are soft, fit well, and actually keep my feet warm. They are synthetic with no cotton and was worried about how they would feel. Actually I like how soft they are, don't slide around, and don't stretch out.",4
"I was so happy to Finally find yoga pants that fit me just right. Well height wise I'm 5'8 so finding yoga that are long are a struggle. These are just right plus I love the fact they're not cotton. Which strinks up and fade, the only thing is I have dog and hair gets stuck to them but whatever nothing a lent roller can't fix. But I could've bought a smaller size but what ever. They run kinda big so it depends on how you like it I like my clothing more fitted.",4

"These are ordinary. Do not expect extra quality. Ordered largest size and no bigger than average size. Not what I would call a sport sock.",4
"This top is more neon than the pic would lead you to believe, and the dark spots are actually black, not grey, and it doesn't match grey bottoms IMO. Otherwise though I love the fit and the cut, offers enough coverage to keep the girls in place without covering them up entirely.",4
"Bought for my daughter at her request. Apparently they are comfortable and fit well.",4
"So comfy! I do wish they sat a tiny bit lower in my shoe so that they would not be seen.",4
"I love the length and the colors. I thought the quality of the fabric was good. I expected the XXL to fit like a women's size 1x, but it was too tight across the bust to run in comfortably, also snug on the belly. The 1x I got at a different store was not as nice quality wise, and a bit shorter- not tights friendly-but I didn't feel as self conscious about the fit on top and at the middle. I was sorry to have had to make the trade off.",4
"I got this suit for lap swimming at the gym, so I just needed something functional and not sexy. This suit is nearly perfect. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the way the bust is constructed.\n\nThere is slight padding, which is necessary for preventing your nipples from showing, but the pads are paper thin and not attached in any way; there is a pocket over each breast that the pads slide into, but because they're so thin and not attached, they twist and bunch up every.single.time I put on the suit, take off the suit, or wash it.\n\nI handwash, so I can manipulate the bust to get the pads to lay flat, but they're also not quite the same shape as the pockets themselves, so lining up the sides takes time, and they still shift around. It can be very frustrating when all I want to do is pull on the suit and go to the gym; sometimes I have to fight with the bust to make it lay flat.\n\nIt's a design flaw that's pointless; they should just be sewn in.",4
"Fits great, but not sure why they put a hook closer on the back. Great for swimming laps!",4
"I have an issue with inner thigh chafing on runs, so I bought these to wear under my running shorts. I have big thighs, so I was concerned that a 4 inch inseam might still ride up, but it didn't at all! It was the perfect length - long enough to not ride up, but short enough to barely show beneath my shorts. I wore these on an 8 mile run and they were very comfortable. My only complaint is that they are on the thin side, so I probably wouldn't wear them alone.",4

"This skirt is comfortable and fits perfect! I didn't give 5 stars because as the other review says, the description says pockets, and there are none. But I don't mind that much. I wore it to a business meeting the day after it came in the mail! I just wish it was available in stores for easier purchasing.",4
"I don't think it mentions the skirt is lined, which is good because the embroidered fabric is slightly scratchy. There's also more peach as a highlight color than the photo shows, which makes it feel like something Navajo or Southwest-y. It's a great skirt that's easy to throw on in the morning and like the photo shows, is awesome paired with black. There's also some gold thread shot throughout, so it can be dressed up. The heavier fabric makes it better for winter.",4
"Beautiful but the color is off....it's not silver as described. It's not even pewter like the picture....more like a dark copper color. I'll still keep it because I like it and most sequin skirts, especially maxi style, are nowhere near the deal I got online for this. Oh, and a few sequins fell off when I tried it on.",4
"The skirt itself is grey while the sequins are a copper color (so it's not really silver). I'm 5'4 and used to having Target's maxi skirts go to the floor, but this one hits above my ankles like on the model in the picture. It occasionally sheds a sequin or two but I would expect this given the price.",4
"My cousins and I purchased this skirt separately for ourselves to wear in a funeral. In our culture we girls have to wear white for the deceased family member. We are all different sizes and shapes and it fit nicely on all of us. The only fault was that there were recognizable holes, not the lace parts of course, but the stitching coming apart. We all did NOT wash prior to wearing and notice the holes the day of the funeral. I hate that I spend $20 on something that not STRONGLY stitched.",4
"This skirt is adorable as far as style is concerned. It does run a bit big, though. My only disappointment is the fact that it is beige and not white. I did not notice a color in the description; however, it appears white in the photo. I really wanted a white skirt, so unfortunately, I will have to return.",4
"The texture, the look, the color, all work for me. I was a little apprehensive about the size, since usually 2s in the Womens section don't always actually fit me, but this one did and I'm so glad I took a chance! The zipper is functional, by the way, so you can zip up or down how much you want. Cute skirt.",4
"Please size up because its not vanity sizing at all here ladies. I'm a 4 and the small was pretty small, i could fit in it, but not comfortably.",4

I wore them at least once a week.\nHOWEVER, they did start to fray a little by the lace, and they decided to rip in the back :( But that could be from me wearing them 24/7. For this price, I would still highly recommend. (I came here to buy more but they're all out :( )",4
"Needed new shorts for an upcoming summer vacation. I had been to the Target store but they did not have this style in my size at the store. I took a chance and ordered them online. I found them to be well made and that little bit of stretch make sure you don't feel pinched when sitting.\n\nThese not only were stylish but a really good fit and comfortable. Even on 90 degree hot summer days I was relaxed and enjoying my vacation.",4
"Very destructed - as in only the white cotton pocket behind the fraying separates you from the world. If you can live with that, they are very much in style and comfortable.",4

"Read all reviews and followed their advise. Purchased these a size smaller and love them. This is my first time wearing them, feel they may stretch out during the day. Only time will tell, but what more can I ask for when they are such a bargain.",4
"I really like them. But, I don't know if I can pull them off- like they say! Best bet for shorts. Really lovely for possible outings! Tight fit but nice look. Very much recommend all. Took forever to find. Not many sizes for this short. Good \",4
"Haven't worn much, but seems to be good quality. The fit is a little off but comfortable enough. The price was a good value.",4

"Love them! So glad they fit so well.",4

"I wear a 40DD - I ordered XL and it fits really well! I was pleasantly surprised as it fits better than the others I bought that were more expensive and go by bra size. I will be making a couple small modifications - The criss cross fabric over the cups is not really attached, so, as others mentioned, I'll be putting a couple stitches in to keep the fabric in place. Also, since I am only 5' tall it is a bit long - I think I'll add some gathers to the sides to make it a little shorter and hide my tummy a little more - thought the pattern does a great job of camouflaging.",4
"These bottoms filled my need for good coverage while chasing my toddler - at the pool, around the backyard kiddie pool, and on the splash pad. The bottoms are cute and modest, but not too matronly. The skirt drapes nicely, but that also means it floats up in the pool water (so check your bum before you get out of the water).",4

"I wear a 40DD - I ordered XL and it fits really well! I was pleasantly surprised as it fits better than the others I bought that were more expensive and go by bra size. I will be making a couple small modifications - The criss cross fabric over the cups is not really attached, so, as others mentioned, I'll be putting a couple stitches in to keep the fabric in place. Also, since I am only 5' tall it is a bit long - I think I'll add some gathers to the sides to make it a little shorter and hide my tummy a little more - thought the pattern does a great job of camouflaging.",4
"I bought these to wear kayaking and paddle boarding. The coverage is great. I bought the L (I typically wear a 8/10) and they are a little big.\n\nI bought the larger size because these type of shorts are typically tighter in the thigh. Not these, though. Great for water sports.",4
"I'm typically a size 2, but I carry my weight at my hips. Small is the bathing suit size I buy, but this in small was too small for me. The scallops stayed in place on the butt and made it flirty and sexy without showing too much. However, the scallops on the waist were folded over. I think it may have been from it being too small. Re-ordered in the medium.",4
"I sized up a size, and it cuts me off a bit, but hopefully over time, it will stretch a bit. SUCH a cute and unique bottom though",4
"I am typically a size small/medium (size 4) and I ordered the medium and it was way too tight. Unless I want to look like a pork sausage, I'm exchanging it for a size up.",4
"These bottoms filled my need for good coverage while chasing my toddler - at the pool, around the backyard kiddie pool, and on the splash pad. The bottoms are cute and modest, but not too matronly. The skirt drapes nicely, but that also means it floats up in the pool water (so check your bum before you get out of the water).",4
"They were a little more snug than I would have wanted them to be, but they do have good coverage! Fit mostly to size, but if you are closer to a bigger size, go bigger.",4
"This is a really cute swim suit and I found it to be flattering. Sadly, I found the torso to be a little short for me. I'm 5ft 10 so this happens to me frequently. If you are average or short this should fit you perfectly.",4
"It took me a good 15 minutes to get it on my body, but once it was on it was quite cute! Great pattern and good fit. The top is not particularly supportive and pulls my chest down a little - maybe the torso just isn't long enough for me. But it still looks good, and I can't wait to wear it in St. Thomas!",4
"Overall, great swimsuit. the design and quality is good. My only complaint is the bust is too large, which I should have taken into account from the other reviews. It is shaped and on the larger side, so I feel like if you are at an odd angle, you may be revealing more than you like. But overall nice, doesn't dig in at the hips which is a plus. I hope washing takes away some of the rigidness of the bust padding.",4
"Wonderful! Was totally worth the money && wait. The color is off by a few or more shades but its nice. First time shopper online. a whole lot more to choose from online than in store.",4
"I bought this for water fitness classes. It's pretty comfortable, but has no bust support and runs a little short. (I'm 5'8\",4
"The only thing I recommend is if you are a size large get a size XL because it runs small. Other than that it's a beautiful bathing suit.",4
"Really cute, but definitely skimpy! The top comes down quite low. I'm going to order a size up and see if that helps.",4
"I needed something cute and quick and this wad perfect",4
"I got this suit for lap swimming at the gym, so I just needed something functional and not sexy. This suit is nearly perfect. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the way the bust is constructed.\n\nThere is slight padding, which is necessary for preventing your nipples from showing, but the pads are paper thin and not attached in any way; there is a pocket over each breast that the pads slide into, but because they're so thin and not attached, they twist and bunch up every.single.time I put on the suit, take off the suit, or wash it.\n\nI handwash, so I can manipulate the bust to get the pads to lay flat, but they're also not quite the same shape as the pockets themselves, so lining up the sides takes time, and they still shift around. It can be very frustrating when all I want to do is pull on the suit and go to the gym; sometimes I have to fight with the bust to make it lay flat.\n\nIt's a design flaw that's pointless; they should just be sewn in.",4
"Fits great, but not sure why they put a hook closer on the back. Great for swimming laps!",4
"While I haven't had a chance to swim in this, yet, I have worn it and found it to be comfortable and very easy to move in, with no uncomfortable tugging anywhere. It is nice to lay around in, and just lounge.",4
"Positives: it's a great suit for people who might not have the body they want. It hides some problem areas that most moms have (stretch marks on the belly, muffin top, etc). It covers the whole butt. I don't feel overly exposed or so covered up that I am not age apporpriate.\nNegative: there is only one, but it's a doozy; there is not enough support for the chest. There is enough space for them to fit comfortably, but they could have done a better job hoisting them into a more flattering position.",4
"I was looking for something fun to wear in the pool while playing with my son that would stay put and not get dragged down in the front. This is very flattering and has a sexy back without being age-inappropriate (I'm in my 40s). I'm 5'6\",4
"Nice ruffle on the bottom.",4
"I like this cover-up. The color is pretty, the cut is great. Not too long and not too short. Just not sure it was worth what I paid.",4
"I have a long face and didn't think they would work for me, I tried them on anyway and loved them! The only thing is that sometimes my hair gets stuck to the chain looking thing on the side, but it's no big deal to me. They're stylish, look great, and are a great price.",4
"Who wants to spend over $20 on sunglasses that get lost, stepped on, caught in between car doors... These look good and are inexpensive. Not sure how long they'll last, obviously for the price they aren't great quality, but I'm happy with it.",4
"These sunglasses as so cute! I didn't realize that they had little square rhinestones on the side. Usually I try to avoid things with rhinestones on them, but these were actually okay. I mean, great for a cheap pair of sunglasses!",4
"Love these sunglasses! They are stylish, with a bit of bling, but not overdone. The nice purple color doesn't overpower my face. And they are super light plastic--if I push them up on my head, they don't snag my hair or give me a headache.",4
"They look modern and work on sunny days :D I thought they would have a more squared form.",4
"These are very nice, but they were WAY too oversized for me. And the supposedly purple lenses were not purple at all, but dark black. The lenses in the picture look semi-translucent, however, I could not see my eyes through the lenses. I resembled a giant fly. Lol! The sunglasses were not flattering on me at all, but they looked great on my sister. So she spared me from having to return them.",4
"they were really cute glasses but very breakable.. but overall i love them.",4
"They look modern and work on sunny days :D I thought they would have a more squared form.",4
"Light weight with polarized, the bridge sits comfortable on my nose.\nThe frame fit the face pretty well.",4
"My eyes are sensitive to bright light. When the eye doc told me UV speeds up degeneration & ages your eyes, I sought out a pair with protection. These were comfortable & wrap around for good coverage. They're polarized to reduce glare from reflective surfaces - great while driving. GMA had a test which showed budget sunglasses blocked UV just as well as $100+ pairs. Since I tend to lose them, this pair under $20, these are great. I've bought two so far.",4

"These sunglasses are very Hollywood and cover a lot of my face, which I like. I gave 4 stars because the frame is all plastic and it feels flimsy, like they might break easily.",4
"These are great sunglasses for a great price. Quality is really good for the price. The only con for me is their weight. They are a little heavy and they leave marks on my nose. But I still love the style.",4
"Everyone wanted to try my new shades. They looked great on different shaped faces.",4
"I bought these sunglasses at my local Target. They were the most comfortable pair of sunglasses that I have had in years. The lenses were big, but not so huge that they looked silly. I prefer them to be a darker tint from top to bottom verses gradient, but these were still fairly dark. My son stepped on them today and they are dead. I'm hoping that I will be able to buy another pair when I go to Target tomorrow - that's how much I liked them!",4
"I bought a pair of these while they were on sale for $5 thinking it wouldn't be a huge loss if they didn't fit or look right. My only regret is not buying more at that price. They fit my rather small head perfectly and keep the sun away from the under eye area, which is why I wanted larger glasses. I then waited several weeks for them to come back in stock but even at full price, ordered 2 more pairs as backups. I can't say much on quality or longevity yet, however.",4
"Classy and trendy! They feel a little cheap, but they definitely fit the bill for casual sunglasses. I got them on sale so I feel pretty good about my purchase, but otherwise I think they are a bit pricey. I still recommend them though!",4
"The quality is fine and they are as pictured, but they are just too large-- they look oversized so I'll be returning them.",4
"Slightly oversized, modern version of the cat-eye style. Not super dark lenses, which make them great for those days when it's sunny but not extremely bright.",4
"I just love these sunglasses. I can't get enough. I like the matte look to them because they feel more stylish. However, I wear these hiking everyday and the heat from my face has melted the rubber on the inside where the glasses sit on the bridge of my nose. Not cute. It took a long time before they started melting so they were pretty scratched up by the time it began. This isn't discouraging since I don't like to worry about taking care of sunglasses. I'm the type to spend less money and replace an item often than fuss over keeping them in a case. New. I like new.",4
"I like them very much !!!!",4
"I would have kept these, except that I didn't realize the bows (the stick next to your temple) had a flowered pattern on them. If you're into that, then I think these would be perfect. I loved the lenses, but chose to keep the electric blue pair instead. They were hotter.",4
"These ARE polarized sunglasses. I have a test card and they passed the test. They are good quality hard plastic frames with very sturdy hinges. They are much prettier in person than in the pic.Nice medium dark lenses.\nNOTE: The little plate decal on each side is not on the glasses I received. It's just flush smooth black plastic. I actually prefer what I got to the pic, but I either received a different pair than what was in the pic or the pair I received simply didn't have it.",4
"Just as described. Very pleased with my purchase.",4
"medium brown color goes with most things, not too big or small. Good basic pair at a good price for every day use.",4
"Everyone wanted to try my new shades. They looked great on different shaped faces.",4
"I love these sunglasses. In the store, I tried them on an instantly knew I loved these.  They have a comfortable fit and are flattering to the face.  However, after 2 months, one of the arms broke off in my purse.  I looked on line and couldn't find them because the pair I was looking for had pink arms, not red.  So I entered in the model # from my broken pair and these came up, so I ordered them.  When they came, they were pink and not red as in the picture.",4
"Comfortable and cute for the price. I was hoping they were more oversized but they will do",4
"I would have kept these, except that I didn't realize the bows (the stick next to your temple) had a flowered pattern on them. If you're into that, then I think these would be perfect. I loved the lenses, but chose to keep the electric blue pair instead. They were hotter.",4
"As high end looking as my Free People slouch beanie. I ordered three colors.",4
"Great arm warmers. got them to replace some I lost that I bought from Target a few years ago. The difference is, these are a bit bulkier. I have a hard time fitting them under my coats. and a bit too long beyond my wrists. Other than that quality made, warm and cozy.",4
"Beautiful hat, shape is very unique and great color.",4
"I haven't worn it out in the cold yet so I can't attest to how well it keeps you warm. I do like how thin/narrow it is in the back so then if you're wearing a coat it won't interfere with the headband and push it up.",4
"I have been searching for a white hat so when I saw it I had to buy it! It's very stylish just a little smaller than my other hats. I still like it a lot!!",4
"This hat is really stylish and cute. It is super light weight. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it fit a bit snug on my head. Other than that, it is exactly what I was looking for.",4
"Great beanie! Love the color! This beanie is roomy and has a larger fit, not tight or snug. This will be a great addition to my winter wardrobe.",4
"It's exactly what I expected. I ordered the brown and the blue. The blue was too purplish for me, but I\",4
"Got these to go with a black and white scarf I bought for my 23 year old daughter. Didn't realize at the time these are black and silver, not black and white. I'll let her decide whether to take them back, as they're still soft and the sparkles may not be that noticeable.",4
"This is a nice beanie and work well when it is cold outside. It is thick and has a fleece liner. I don't need a beanie this thick and warm. I'm keeping the beanie, but will be buying a beanie that is not so think and warm. It is well made and looks good on.",4
"Arrived a day later than scheduled. Not a big deal. I have a small head, so it's nice that it fits.",4
"Bought for my mother and it was too big for her.",4
"it's a little tall but it's very comfortable, lightweight, and exactly what I wanted.",4
"I love the look and feel of these gloves! They are super soft and keep my hands warm on chilly mornings. My only complaint is that they are a one size fits all which in this case is a little snug. I think I have pretty average sized hands if not on the small side but I do have longers fingers. Overall I am happy and plan to keep them.",4
"Very pretty and teal color is true to photo. I am a petite woman, 5' 2\",4
"Received this hat in the mail a few days ago and I'm happy with this purchase. Very cute and stylish and material seems like it'll hold up well even though it's thin. Not sure if it'll be warm enough for winter though. Will probably be better as a fall item.",4
"Ok let me be honest and say I have a larger than average head for a woman and slouch hats never look right but this was perfect! And the black is not faded like I have seen on other knit hats. I also really like the checker board pattern. I have it a 4 star only because I would have liked it to be thicker. But other than that great! Might buy it in other colors!",4
"I got this to wear during cold weather cycling. It's thin enough to fit comfortably under a helmet, it covers the ears (even over bulky wireless earbuds) and has a ponytail opening in back. This was exactly what I was looking for. The only negative is that it could be just a smidge more fitted (and I don't have a particularly small head) - fine for cycling, but if you were to wear it for running it might move around.",4
"The gloves fit...like a glove! Blue is a great color.",4
"Perfect for cool to cold days. Operating my cell phone is actually easy with the gloves on. Just wished the gloves were a tad bit longer",4
"This is the first hat that isn't tight on my head and I have big naturally curly hair. Love it!",4
"The hat is well made and nice looking. It is very thin though, and porous, so it does not add much warmth at all.",4
"Very cute hat. It came exactly as described on the website and looks great on!",4
"very cute hat! perfect for new hat wearers",4
"This headband is really cute and comfortable.",4
"Super stylish and great for the price.",4
"I bought this hat for myself. It fits well on my head and is cute from the front but from the side it looks a little weird as it is very slouchy. I decided to keep it as I just need something to keep my head and ears warm during the cold mornings.",4
"Nice but don't work with touch screens. They are comfortable and cozy enough for driving. They won't work on my iPhone, don't know if they would work with other touchscreens.",4
"I love my beanie! I live in Phoenix so it's perfect for the weather here but it might not hold up in the lower temperatures. Also the band is a little complicated, it doesn't hold a flip too well and it gets streched pretty easily, My daughter got a hold of it and stretched out so I had to wash it and dry it for it to got back to the original fit. Other than that it's made out of good material and the colors are amazing whether you wear it inside in or inside out!",4
"Ok for the sale price . I had bought one before for my daughter",4
"I have this hat in three colors now. Get lots of compliments. Love them. Only complaint is it can get stretched out, but 5 minutes in the dryer fixes it just fine.",4
"Good item for the best price",4
"The color of this beanie is beautiful, and I can't complain about the quality for the price. However, the hem is pretty tight and it didn't feel comfortable on me. Luckily my partner likes it. I noticed that it looks a lot better on my partner, who has long hair and an oval-shaped face, than it does on me, with short hair and a round face. I would wait and try it on in the store if you're not sure.",4
"Very Good Quality but price is more",4
"The design is creative, however it could be improved. It presses too hard against my ears especially when I'm using earphones+ eyeglasses.",4
"Wore these on long walk on a cold day and they stayed in place. My ears were kept very warm! Love that they wrap around the back the neck.",4
"The adjustable strap is Velcro and if your hair type is curly or especially Afro textured/kinky word of caution the strap may cause breakage. I bought all three colors for styling alternatives and those many bad/lazy hair days and I found that I can't wear my natural hair loose with these hats because it gets caught in the Velcro. One solution is to keep the Velcro unexposed but depending on how big your head and/or hair is that obviously may be impractical. I decided to keep that hats and just wear my hair up in big twists/protective styles to guard against breakage.",4
"super casual & cute to look at but big on me so returning it.\nfyi, i have a small-medium sized head with a small forehead.",4
"They're not very thick but, they fit nice and look great. Very good for light weight gloves.",4
"I love how thick and plush they are AND they are VERY warm! I spend a great deal of time at indoor ice rinks for my daughters' lessons, and my hands are no longer cold. However they state one size fits all and I have small hands, and not sure how well they would fit on larger hands. Could be a tad longer up the wrist too.",4
"I believe I have a smaller head, so this hat is a little big on me. It could also be the way I wear it (slouchy). It's soft, and I love its pattern and colors. Perfect for fall since it's still a little sunny out, and winter hats tend to be less colorful.",4
"The hat kept its shape perfectly during shipping and is very cute. It does not come in different sizes and my head runs on the larger size so unfortunately it didnt fit and I have to return it. Overall though very stylish and material feels comfy",4
"This is a really cute hat and appears to be quite well made for the price. The only thing is that the brim was a lot bigger than expected. I thought I'd try something other than the popular fedora style, but I'm not sure about it yet. It's kind of between the fedora and a large-brimmed sun hat. I'll probably keep it because it was such a good price, but it still feels like an awkward size. Hoping I get used to it because it's so cute!",4
"Was looking for a hat like this everywhere else except Target. So one day I was on here shopping for other things & came across this hat & the price, YESSSSSSSS!! I've been looking at others priced at $50-200 :( that I was going to purchase. They only had it online & it took about a week or so to come but once it arrived & I got it home I LOVE IT!! The only problem I have it that I have a small head so it is a tad bit lose but for $11.90 I can work with it. It looks great & expensive! Great purchase & I am a satisfied customer!! I love Target!!!",4
"It's hard to find white winter gloves as they are required for my job uniform. These are perfect as you can wear them covered or fingerless. I have to wear a glove liner as the thumb is fingerless but that is not much of a problem.",4
"runs a little small but is beautiful",4
"I understand all the negative reviews as I had the same issue with my right foot...first time I wore them rubbed a small area raw on the top of my foot. I put a bandaid over the area and continued to wear them with no problem. Now I wear them all the time and no more rubbing...maybe they stretched out a bit. I did loosen the bottom strap on both sandals by one hole which helped. I really love these sandals now...",4
"I have a low arch and instep, and absolutely must wear a supportive shoe at all times. These shoes don't rub on me, and if they did I'd take them off before I got blisters, silly people. Like many full platform shoes, these don't bend, and I knew that, so I'm not complaining that these shoes aren't exactly cross country walkers. For me, they are excellent for wearing around the house, especially standing and doing dishes, or canning, as the footbed is very similar to a birkenstock, and very supportive. Plus, they are incredibly cute on my feet, and give me an extra 1 1/2 inches of height.",4
"Dress them up, or dress them down. Versatile and cute! I've purchased these sandals in years prior, but this year it seems these will take some wearing in. The straps are a bit stiff in between the toes as well as the design above the foot. I wore them for one day and the bed several days following I couldn't wear them because it hurt too badly in the spots where the sandals had rubbed. Darn it, and I was so excited! But, here's hoping I'll get to continue wearing them!",4
"Very cute, light and comfortable. I had to adjust the buckle to the last hole on the top because they felt a little loose across the top of my foot. Other than that, no complaints.",4
"Very cute, light and comfortable. I had to adjust the buckle to the last hole on the top because they felt a little loose across the top of my foot. Other than that, no complaints.",4
"I like these flip flops because they are very comfortable-the sole is cushioned and has great arch support, which is awesome for a sandal to have. I also love the heel strap because it keeps it on the foot, which eliminates toe fatigue that occurs in traditional flip flops. The only bad part is like the other reviewer mentioned-the toe strap is uncomfortably tight (I got these in the mult-color design too and it's tight on them as well). I can only hope it will loosen over time. Oh and also if your feet are wet while wearing these they might make an embarrassing noise!",4
"I normally wear a size 7 but I had to get a size 8 because the straps are tight or short or something. I definitely recommend going a size larger than what you normally wear. I have never worn even close to an 8 in my life but this shoe runs super small. Also the foot bed is super soft like walking on a marshmallow. Very comfy.",4
"bought them a half size bigger, because when i tried them on in the store they tend to make your foot come towards the front. Because of the strong elastic the part in between your toes gets sore after a couple of hours of wear",4
"They're great! Perfect fit! They're a little slippery, but that's fine! Can't beat this!",4
"These sandals are beautiful in person! They run a little small, so I would order the next size up!",4
"These sandals are absolutely adorable!! They are very comfortable and can be worn with basically anything! The downside is that they do run about a 1/2 size small. I typically wear an 8 and they were a little snug, but I tried on an 8 1/2 and they are perfect! Love these, plan on ordering another pair since mine are a little worn from wearing them so often.",4
"Love these shoes. They are a good price, cute, and very comfortable.",4
"The shoes are definitely comfortable. I typically wear a size 7.5 or 8. I got an 8 to be safe and they fit fine. The shoe is cute, but not as dark as pictured. They are a little lighter in person. Disappointed. But still cute and can be worn in my opinion more casually.",4
"Wish I could give a full 5 stars, but these sandals had a very strong odor when I received them! It took a week of airing them outside before the odor dissipated. Now that they don't smell, they are very comfy and I receive a lot of compliments on them! Good price for them, Target never disappoints me!",4
"Super comfortable and great for height. I've had mine a few months however and I've walked a lot in them and the straps have started to come off a bit. Not surprising considering, but I would still reccomend",4
"Love these flip flops! Typical foam like flip flop, will work great for short period of time use!!!",4
"The shoes are of good quality and the price is great! They are very cute on and I have bought 2 pair so far. These are a little tight, but the first pair are perfect. I hope they stretch out a little when I wear them more.",4

"Lovely sandal. Cut small. Thankfully I ordered a size 9 (my normal size) and 10, as footbed sandals have a tendency to be cut small. I kept the size 10 for myself and gave the size 9 to my mother. She loves them as well. Not very much padding or comfort, but I still wear them daily. They also leave the imprint of your foot on the inside, but overall...cute!",4
"The color is as pictured. True to size. I have wide feet and they feel pretty comfortable. (Not for a lot of walking though.)",4
"They're great! Perfect fit! They're a little slippery, but that's fine! Can't beat this!",4
"I actually bought these shoes for my mom and she seem to like them very much. They are true to size and color. Plan on buying her some in yellow.",4

"I bought this towel primarily for use at water aerobics. I wanted something that didn't look like a beach towel. This is cute and the fabric feels sturdy. I love that it's bright and colorful. It brightens my day to use this.",4
"Colors are great. Towel is large and rather thin- but expected this for the price!",4
"Great color, and sturdy materials. This towel is pretty durable. I also like the size of the towel. It's not to small, and I'm able to use it anywhere, especially if I'm at the pool or at the beach.",4
"This bra is very comfortable and I'm happy with my purchase. I'm normally a 34 D or DD and bought a 34 F/G and it just fits now (8 months pregnant), but I'm worried that when my milk comes in it won't fit. I had to use the extender that came with the bra and I'm just fitting into the cups. It also gives me a uni-boob look, but at this point the comfort that I feel from this bra compared to the ones I was wearing before outweighs the uni-boob look. I would recommend this bra but I would consider buying a size bigger than you think you'll need if you're a larger chested woman like myself.",4
"I like this bra but prefer the silk seamless style also by Bravado - I got both when I purchased this one and this one is just not as stretchy. It offers good support and the piping in orchid is very pretty!",4
"Great comfort and support but would like a little coverage in the front area.",4
"This bra is lovely, comfortable and fits nicely. My only complaint is that the straps are too wide-set in the back causing them to slip off my shoulders - often. (and I have quite wide shoulders) I'm returning the ones I haven't worn and going back to the ones with the butterfly lace in the front.",4
"this was nice, it was my favorite out of the 4 i bought.",4
"On my second set of these bras. They're very comfortable, good with t-shirts and great for travel.",4
"Very happy with bras. I most likely will not order again as shipping is way over priced.",4
"Love the look and fit of this bra... VERY comfortable",4
"I love everything about the bra except it scratches on the edging by the hooks. I think it's the thread stitching. I have to sew a little fabric over it with every new one I get. Please change this edging and I'd be so happy!",4
"Great bra (looks and features). I just wish that the band size went higher than 42.",4

"this was nice, it was my favorite out of the 4 i bought.",4
"On my second set of these bras. They're very comfortable, good with t-shirts and great for travel.",4
"Very happy with bras. I most likely will not order again as shipping is way over priced.",4
"Love the look and fit of this bra... VERY comfortable",4
"I love everything about the bra except it scratches on the edging by the hooks. I think it's the thread stitching. I have to sew a little fabric over it with every new one I get. Please change this edging and I'd be so happy!",4
"Great bra (looks and features). I just wish that the band size went higher than 42.",4
"The cup is not a \",4
"My daughter needed these for her dance recital and they worked out perfectly.  Spent a little more than I intended as the others we wanted were out of stock but it was worth it at least",4
"I've been buying this style for years. The one thing I wish they'd change: make the gel portion of the strap longer - it seems to start mid-shoulder and extend to the front. Would be nicer if it also extended to the back the same length.",4
"I like the gel straps which makes this bra very comfortable. I had brought this bra before but for some reason I got the wrong size cup. My mistake. Other than that all good.",4
"Very comfortable. Good support. Wish it came in size smaller than 38. Won't be able to use much longer since I'm losing weight.",4
"I have been wearing this bra for years ans absolutely love it? M y only wish is that they makers would move the gel strap back slightly on the shoulder. The bigger the size you are the more the strap seems to be to far forward on the shoulder. Otherwise, absolutely love, love , love this bra.",4
"I have worn this bra for about 2 weeks now and most of the time, I don't even realize that I have it on. I have a large chest and the straps are a godsend. Very good Bra.",4
"This bra fit well and true to size. It is attractive and fairly well supportive. I can't give it as a high a recommendation as some of the playtex products. The materials the bra is made with are lighter weight than the Playtex bras and other higher end bras. For that reason I don't think it will last very long before breaking down. At 15 dollars though, it's a bargain.",4
"I like it but would not order it again as I prefer wider support in the underarm sections that this style does not have; I tried these since I cannot afford mastectomy bras and they \",4
"I bought three of these, they are my favorite to wear with all clothing",4
"I need a bra that minimizes! This bra does that and more. Although I need the back and cup size, I find the straps could go a little tighter and even though I have on tightest, it's not as tight as I would prefer but still works for me.",4
"I recommend this bra for small waisted, heavy busted women.",4
"I am happy with these bras because I am a hard fit and these look nice and are mostly comfortable. I've had one problem though, and that is that 2 out of 6 of this style that I have purchased were defective (the side plastic supports were not sewn in correctly and therefore cut into my skin), which I didn't find out until too late to return them. I would recommend checking this bra carefully, but that is my only complaint.",4
"Unlike other minimizes, this model lifts and separates. I am please with the three hook closure. Great support for 34DD",4
"runs a little small but now that i know that i will be able to order a larger size in the future",4
"I like but underwrite is uncomfortable. I will recommend it to family and friends.",4
"I like my purchase very much comfortable and easy to wear and fits nicely",4
"This is the only bra I that fits me well and I have it in every color. The thing that drives me crazy is that the lace catches all the sweater fuzz from my clothes and pills up on the bra. It's next to impossible to remove. Perhaps a less abrasive lace fabric would be nice.",4
"Lilyette has gotten inconsistent with their sizing, but this style is still true to size. The cups feel nice and there is good bounce control but I would not recommend it as a workout bra. The elastic can be annoying at first but once it is broken in, I found it manageable. My only complaint is that the side panels came up to my underarms. I am 5'2\",4
"I'm a 72 year old woman who wears a 44 DDD bra. I'm tired of bras that hurt. And, I am tired of the center of the bra failing by sticking out after a week.Finally a comfortable underwire!",4
"I've worn this one for years but the elastic breaks like little rubber worms but fits best for large cup women.",4
"I love this bra, the only way to improve would be to make straps wider at shoulder area for us who have heavy breasts and need shoulder' s cushioned",4
"Comfortable, fit well. Well made.Good color. Good color choice.",4
"Mine was on back order, but I got it rather quickly in white as I requested. It fits me well, even though I have gained weight and the cup size was good. I wanted a no wire bra, I guess it was my error. Overall it fits well, and a nice summer bra.",4
"The black bra came in the mail yesterday and I realized I have a lot of shirts that need a black bra so I tried them on with it and it was good. The beige one showed through most of my clothes that need a skin colored bra, probably because I'm so pale. Maybe I will try the ivory one. This bra will show a seam and or lace through some shirts. It makes your boobs cone shaped but this looks good in some shirts. I don't consider this minimizing, just not accentuating. I guess I wanted my boobs squished. The search is still on for a minimizing bra I'm in love with. This bra isn't perfect but it's a god bra to have around.",4

"Very nice for ease of access when you're extra sleepy during late night feedings. Bought these so I didn't have to sleep in nursing bras with under wire anymore. My only complaint is I have large breasts and they don't necessarily provide support and the straps really dig into my shoulders and across my upper back from the weight of my breasts.",4
"$9.99? Sold, fits well for the price.",4
"I have bought this same bra before and the only complaint I have is there is not enough adjustment of the straps available; otherwise, good value and very comfortable to wear.",4
"Super comfortable, fits well. Seems to be good construction. I have only washed a couple times so far.",4
"I bought these a month ago and they are very comfortable. The fit is great and the support is even better ! The only problem is how come they aren't offered in black? Great buy and I will buy again in the future.",4
"True to size, quality fabric and great support. It holds you together and up but for me it created perspiration between breasts creating sweaty odor. Perhaps I have wrong size? Size 50 DD & maybe should be 52 DD?",4
"I say \",4
"soft; comfortable minimizer; I'm very large breasted and I don;t know how long the support will hold up\n\na good value for the price",4
"Comfortable bra. Seems pretty true to size. It lays flat where it should and doesn't roll at all. The straps are padded enough so no digging into my shoulders.",4
"Delivered in a timely manner but was too costly for my taste.",4
"This is now my go to bra. However, the material is not particularly soft, so if you're super sensitive to fabric, this is not the right bra for you. I like the shape (not too pointy), and I like the support. The only thing that I don't like is that they don't hold up well. I've managed to put my fingers through the band that goes around the chest when adjusting it a couple of times, and after a couple of months, the elastic in the band around the chest is in shambles (even though the bras never go in the dryer) and the bra needs to be replaced.",4
"I returned this product because the back hooks were too wide and therefore uncomfortable for me. Quality of product was good, just not fit for me. My return was handled extremely well and I definitely would recommend this company.",4
"Absolutely love my Bali Lace 'n Smooth Underwire Bras! However, I will mention this....Quite a few years ago, I bought size 34 DD in this exact same bra, still have them and they still fit beautifully. However in this latest purchase, I found I had to order size 36 DD for them to fit the same way. I don't understand this, but at least I did figure it out. Love this bra and will continue to buy them.",4
"I love this bra. I have been buying this particular style of bra for YEARS. It fits well, it has enough support (38DD). It is comfortable.\nMy only (small) complaint is that after a while, the lace does tend to stretch out and doesn't support as well. But I hand wash them to help them last longer and never put them in a dryer.\nI do wish that this EXACT same style/shape came in a smooth cup, so I could wear it under more snug shirts, but all in all, I love this bra and will cry if they are no longer made!",4
"I'm a youthful, large bosomed woman who needs good support. I have bought far more expensive bras that didn't give my girls the lift they needed. This one does the trick.",4
"ordered two bras, the fit is great and the colors correct, but one size is incorrect, returned it and waiting and waiting for my return.",4
"I have been buying and wearing this bra for several years. It is so simple just go online and order the same bra I have been wearing. It is pretty, comfortable and keeps my girls perky.",4
"This is alway been my favorite bra, because of the support you get, keeps everything in place, the only thing is, you can see though it, needs more lining. Didn't give it 5 stars cause of that.",4
"I ordered three different brands of bras at the same time and so far this Bali wears the best. I will definitely order more.",4
"I've been wearing this model for the past 10 years. I tried a lot of other more expensive brands. No other products matched this one. I don't even try anymore . I'm sticking with this Bali model for as long as its in production .",4
"Love the Bali Lane 'n Smooth Bras, but the jersey capris run small and have returned them",4
"Like it alot, and will continue to wear them as my bra of choice.",4
"I love this bra but have had them before and the underwire snapped on three of them in the past year What would cause that?",4
"Bought this bra and loved it..will definitely purchase again.",4
"I Love all the color choices. Would (and did) highly recommend to my friends.",4
"This is the only style I wear that gives me a natural look and not a flat spread out look.",4
"This bra run smaller than the other bras that I have bought from you.",4
"I have had several of these bras, but there is too much show through. The style, sizing, support of this bra is great; don't change that! Please just add a thin padded/foam lining to prevent show through.",4
"I have been wearing this bra for past several years. Love the support that it gives me when wearing my forms. Straps stay in place and just over all a great bra.",4
"This bra is pretty comfortable, especially because I can make the straps tighter. Most bras now do not have long enough straps to adjust tighter & they constantly fall off my shoulders.\nI would have given it the highest rating if the material under the bust was softer. One side is kinda scratchy & hurts after all day's wear.",4
"i have been looking for non-padded bras for a while now and couldn't find any for a reasonable price. i found this site by accident and checked out their bras. i ordered one and as a result purchased two more. they fit true to size and i get all day comfort from them. they are a nice looking bra and are supportive.\nthe material could be softer, but i like the bras.. lining in cups. wash nicely...",4
"I've worn this bra for years, but I have to replace quite often because the lining tears or the sides do not hold up. The lace begins to have strings from it. I wish the sides were made of a sturdier material.",4
"I love the way this bra fits very comfort will buy again.",4
"This is the bra I grab when I want a really pretty silhouette, makes even my 34DD's perky! However, it's not an 18-hour bra. It's not really even a 10 hour bra. After awhile, it starts digging in to my skin under my bust and underarms, leaving red welts.\n\nI've tried loosening the band, or using an extender, but then it doesn't support as well. Let's face it, to support a heavy chest, the band has to be tight enough not to move, and this one, if it's tight enough, leaves marks late in the day.\n\nThat said, I still would order again, for the perky-factor alone.",4
"I am large-busted, and the bra fits fine, but is very thin, so it doesn't conceal enough for me under thin garments. I only wear one of the two I bought under thick sweaters or heavy fabric. I prefer a minimizer style that doesn't emphasize my large chest.",4
"Great fit in the cups and the back offers good support and stays down if you are full-busted.\nHowever, there are no comfort features such as straps that don't dig into my shoulders, padding over the closure or even tagless information.\nThat makes this a good bra, but not a great bra.",4
"It fits well but the cups are larger than most bras in the same size, because of this the side wires rub on the inside of my arms. I do like the lift and hold but the rubbing makes me wear the bra for short times only. The fabric on the bra is a little scratchy as well.",4
"This Bali is my 2nd favorite Bali. It does have good support but the band width fit runs a little snug. I wear a 36-C and in this bra I have to wear it on the last hook. I feel like a 38 would be to big. But, it is a great seamless, no padding bra - without stretch straps which is a must for me.",4
"It runs a little snug but after a few wearings/washings it seems to stretch out just about right.",4
"This bra is perfect for great natural look under everyday sweaters and tops that you want the natural full coverage look. I am a 36DD\nand this bra has always been comfortable, firm fitting, somewhat sexy by the sheer lace of it and great under things that are not low cut.\nFor some reason though the Black lately seems to be running (not so true to Black) One had a rosy tint and another time one had a faded black tint, they were not true dark black. I still kept them ..they are a good price and it wasn't worth sending them back. I have ordered these bras from this company for at least 8 years.",4
"This bra is very pretty and provides great support for a large bust. My only disappointment is that the lace is very scratchy and uncomfortable to wear for a long day. I even tried to wash it several times but that made no difference.",4

I've managed to put my fingers through the band that goes around the chest when adjusting it a couple of times, and after a couple of months, the elastic in the band around the chest is in shambles (even though the bras never go in the dryer) and the bra needs to be replaced.",4
"I returned this product because the back hooks were too wide and therefore uncomfortable for me. Quality of product was good, just not fit for me. My return was handled extremely well and I definitely would recommend this company.",4
"Absolutely love my Bali Lace 'n Smooth Underwire Bras! However, I will mention this....Quite a few years ago, I bought size 34 DD in this exact same bra, still have them and they still fit beautifully. However in this latest purchase, I found I had to order size 36 DD for them to fit the same way. I don't understand this, but at least I did figure it out. Love this bra and will continue to buy them.",4
"I love this bra. I have been buying this particular style of bra for YEARS. It fits well, it has enough support (38DD). It is comfortable.\nMy only (small) complaint is that after a while, the lace does tend to stretch out and doesn't support as well. But I hand wash them to help them last longer and never put them in a dryer.\nI do wish that this EXACT same style/shape came in a smooth cup, so I could wear it under more snug shirts, but all in all, I love this bra and will cry if they are no longer made!",4
"I'm a youthful, large bosomed woman who needs good support. I have bought far more expensive bras that didn't give my girls the lift they needed. This one does the trick.",4
"ordered two bras, the fit is great and the colors correct, but one size is incorrect, returned it and waiting and waiting for my return.",4
"I have been buying and wearing this bra for several years. It is so simple just go online and order the same bra I have been wearing. It is pretty, comfortable and keeps my girls perky.",4
"This is alway been my favorite bra, because of the support you get, keeps everything in place, the only thing is, you can see though it, needs more lining. Didn't give it 5 stars cause of that.",4
"I ordered three different brands of bras at the same time and so far this Bali wears the best. I will definitely order more.",4
"I've been wearing this model for the past 10 years. I tried a lot of other more expensive brands. No other products matched this one. I don't even try anymore . I'm sticking with this Bali model for as long as its in production .",4

"Like it alot, and will continue to wear them as my bra of choice.",4
"I love this bra but have had them before and the underwire snapped on three of them in the past year What would cause that?",4
"Bought this bra and loved it..will definitely purchase again.",4
"I Love all the color choices. Would (and did) highly recommend to my friends.",4
"This is the only style I wear that gives me a natural look and not a flat spread out look.",4
"This bra run smaller than the other bras that I have bought from you.",4
"I have had several of these bras, but there is too much show through. The style, sizing, support of this bra is great; don't change that! Please just add a thin padded/foam lining to prevent show through.",4
"I have been wearing this bra for past several years. Love the support that it gives me when wearing my forms. Straps stay in place and just over all a great bra.",4
"This bra is pretty comfortable, especially because I can make the straps tighter. Most bras now do not have long enough straps to adjust tighter & they constantly fall off my shoulders.\nI would have given it the highest rating if the material under the bust was softer. One side is kinda scratchy & hurts after all day's wear.",4
"i have been looking for non-padded bras for a while now and couldn't find any for a reasonable price. i found this site by accident and checked out their bras. i ordered one and as a result purchased two more. they fit true to size and i get all day comfort from them. they are a nice looking bra and are supportive.\nthe material could be softer, but i like the bras.. lining in cups. wash nicely...",4
"I've worn this bra for years, but I have to replace quite often because the lining tears or the sides do not hold up. The lace begins to have strings from it. I wish the sides were made of a sturdier material.",4
"I love the way this bra fits very comfort will buy again.",4
"This is the bra I grab when I want a really pretty silhouette, makes even my 34DD's perky! However, it's not an 18-hour bra. It's not really even a 10 hour bra. After awhile, it starts digging in to my skin under my bust and underarms, leaving red welts.\n\nI've tried loosening the band, or using an extender, but then it doesn't support as well. Let's face it, to support a heavy chest, the band has to be tight enough not to move, and this one, if it's tight enough, leaves marks late in the day.\n\nThat said, I still would order again, for the perky-factor alone.",4
"I am large-busted, and the bra fits fine, but is very thin, so it doesn't conceal enough for me under thin garments. I only wear one of the two I bought under thick sweaters or heavy fabric. I prefer a minimizer style that doesn't emphasize my large chest.",4
"Great fit in the cups and the back offers good support and stays down if you are full-busted.\nHowever, there are no comfort features such as straps that don't dig into my shoulders, padding over the closure or even tagless information.\nThat makes this a good bra, but not a great bra.",4
"It fits well but the cups are larger than most bras in the same size, because of this the side wires rub on the inside of my arms. I do like the lift and hold but the rubbing makes me wear the bra for short times only. The fabric on the bra is a little scratchy as well.",4
"This Bali is my 2nd favorite Bali. It does have good support but the band width fit runs a little snug. I wear a 36-C and in this bra I have to wear it on the last hook. I feel like a 38 would be to big. But, it is a great seamless, no padding bra - without stretch straps which is a must for me.",4
"It runs a little snug but after a few wearings/washings it seems to stretch out just about right.",4
"This bra is perfect for great natural look under everyday sweaters and tops that you want the natural full coverage look. I am a 36DD\nand this bra has always been comfortable, firm fitting, somewhat sexy by the sheer lace of it and great under things that are not low cut.\nFor some reason though the Black lately seems to be running (not so true to Black) One had a rosy tint and another time one had a faded black tint, they were not true dark black. I still kept them ..they are a good price and it wasn't worth sending them back. I have ordered these bras from this company for at least 8 years.",4
"This bra is very pretty and provides great support for a large bust. My only disappointment is that the lace is very scratchy and uncomfortable to wear for a long day. I even tried to wash it several times but that made no difference.",4

"I'm very happy with this purchase! Very comfortable and everything stays in place.",4
"This is my favorite every day bra. I have purchased several over the years, so I could rate it as Excellent. I have also bought it in different sizes due to weight loss. Great fit, and minimizes perfectly. Unfortunately, on EVERY bra I have purchased, I have to cut off the edges of the on the hook and clasp portions. Those edges, however they area made, dig into my skin and cause bleeding. I have never had that trouble with any other bra I have ever owned.",4

"This bra is so comfy by the other ones I have for less than a year had ripped in the front",4
"One of my favorites (DDD cup), it fits very well, doesn't poke and gives great lift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that the hardware to adjust the straps is made of metal which slightly cuts in and it tends to slip a bit, not enough to be annoying or visible but could be better!",4

Because of this and the fact that I hate and can't tolerate a super tight bra I wear the patterns out first....very familiar with this bra, great minimizer.",4
"IMO the Bali Passion for Comfort is a big improvement over the Satin Tracings minimizer! The cup size fits perfectly, it actually minimizes my bust, the underwire looks normal (doesn't jut out in front like Satin Tracings does) AND looks natural under clothes. My only complaint is the so-called \",4
"I picked this bra up at the outlet store. It fits well and is not fussy which I like. I just wish the 32D came in black. Couldn't find it either online or at the store. Great price too.",4
"I have had so much trouble finding a bra that is actually comfortable. Most of them are like a torture device. This is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn. It is so smooth and silky, has great support and I don't overflow the cups. I am very active and do a fair amount of physical labor so I really appreciate a bra that is kind to me. I am going to order more. Thanks Bali!!",4
"Love the way this bra fits so soft supports very good too will buy again.",4
"I needed to switch bras since they were no longer making the Passion for Comfort bra I adored and have ordered for many years. This particular bra I found in a store and decided to try it on to see if I liked it. It was a great replacement for me. I always go to stores to try on bras that I think I may like and then order online since the prices are so much better. This was a great choice for me and I would definitely recommend it. The fit is very good and it stays in place all day without feeling the need to adjust.",4
"I love this bra but I wish it was in larger cup sizes like F & G. You must be careful because the thin cloth between the cups tends to tear ealily. This happend on 3 I bought of this bra. Why do they make minimizers but not in larger sizes?",4

"I love this bra. It is the perfect fit and one of the few minimizer bras that come in size 32. I've bought this in nude, black, and white and will buy the new colors being offered. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more coverage. Still, it is a great bra.",4

"The fit is perfect for me! And having a 3-hook closure makes a big difference in comfort, vs. the 2-hook closure. This style is so comfortable I can wear it all day, and not be anxious to take it off. The color selection is awesome and let's me have fun and be playful in my choice for the day.",4
"This is the most comfortable bra that I've ever worn. Soft, not scratchy, supportive, not binding. This is my favorite everyday bra, I can wear it longer then any bra I've ever owned.

"This is my favorite every day bra. I have purchased several over the years, so I could rate it as Excellent. I have also bought it in different sizes due to weight loss.

"The band is almost too loose, but it works due to the tension of the material around the cups. The cup padding might be too warm in summer, but is okay now. The exterior cup fabric snags easily in the wash. So the nice look may not last too well.",4
"I brought 2 black and 2 white. They are amazingly comfortable. One slight problem I have is that my bust is heavy and sometimes they start to fall out of the cups. The elastic around the bottom could do with being a little tighter. But still love this bra!",4
"Soft and comfortable, easy on the shoulders but tends to roll under the breasts if you are a little overweight",4
"This bra is comfortable and soft, and I love the way it feels. Straps are wide enough to be comfy also. This bra doesn't have a lot of support because its wireless, but I knew that going in. Will order these again.",4
"I love love the comfort of this problem, but I hate the straps. They are too long and I find they do not lift me up enough. The other problem with the straps after you adjust them where you want them and put the bra on they creep down during the day. So comfort of this bra is amazing, but I am now switching to a different bra after wearing this particular one for over 5 years. I cannot deal with the strap issue any long. Very true to fit.",4
"No pictures but they would look great if I was going to be a lot younger",4
"The fit and support are excellent. Since it is flexible, I am reserving judgment to make sure it holds up after a lot of use. As of several weeks of wear, it is my favorite.",4
"I had a couple of these bras and just purchased 3 more. They are comfortable and the straps stay up on my shoulders, which is usually a problem.\n\nI think the cup size runs small.",4
"I am enjoying the comfort of my 3 bras I purchased but I believe the cups are a bit oversized",4
"It is comfortable and has good support. Some under wire bras are not comfortable.",4
"the only problem is that runs a little bigger the my usual size",4
"I bought two of these with the swirl design fronts. They are super comfortable. I wasn't sure of the cup size, so I went with the larger and was glad I did. The disappointing thing is, after 3 washes, even though I take them out of the washer and hang them dry, the front fabric started to pill. After 6 washes, all the fabric is falling apart at the seams. The pilling was so bad on the white one, at that point I threw it away.",4
"This is a comfortable wire-free bra, and out of the package was beautiful. Unfortunately, after 2 washings in washing machine, it snagged (mine was the one with design on the fabric). None of my previous purchases of this bra had this problem. If I re-order, I will order plain fabric style.",4
"I purchased this bra a few weeks ago and love the comfortable feel of it. The support is good, better than I expected for a non-wire bra, and I'm going to order more colors.",4
"This bra would have been perfect except it is really uncomfortable and scratchy where the hooks are located in back. Otherwise the fit, lift, etc. were perfect. I just don't know what I will do with it because of this problem.",4
"this is probably the most comfortable bra that I have ever worn at any time in my life. You literally feel like you don't have anything on underneath your clothes. I am just not 100% sure that I am getting the same support that I have received from other much less comfortable bras and that is why I rated this bra as a good rather than an excellent",4
"It's very comfortable. I just wished you could adjust it from the front straps, instead you have to take the bra off to adjust the straps. But everything else is great about the bra.",4
"This is the bra I pull out of the laundry as soon as it is dry. Comfortable all day, great coverage, looks good under clothes. My only reason for 4 stars is I am not sure how durable it will be - the bottom band is so soft, it seems like it might stretch out relatively quickly. That said, if this bra only lasts a month each, it is worth it to me.",4
"Great comfort here. I cannot wear underwire, and this is a good option. Never binding or pinching. My only regret is there is some pilling of the fabric. Otherwise it would be 5 stars",4
"I miss the bras with concealing petals, but this one is very comfortable.",4
"This bra is very comfortable and provides good support. My only complaint is that as a D cup I have some spillage at the top of the cup resulting in not as smooth of a look as I would prefer.",4
"Hoped that it would cover more but, it is a good fit.",4
"Great fit for every day wear. Retains its shape after several washings. Would like to see color range expanded. Otherwise, very satisfied with my purchase.",4
"I am quite active and I love the way this bra stays in place without binding me like a sports bra. Initially I ordered 3 bras but I quickly ordered more. Thanks.",4
". i'm so glad that i bought this bra. when i put this bra on i fell in love with it right away. the fit is so comfortable that i didn't what to take it off.it fits and looks very becoming",4
"I purchased this bra in black. It has Very simple lines and is one of the most comfortable bras I've had.",4
"This is a comfortable bra, but it runs a little too large to offer enough support. The straps are very soft and don't lift quite enough. The sides are a little soft, too. It might fit better if I went down a size.",4
"This bra is well constructed and fits me well. I love the fact that it isn't so thin as to show high beams when I get cold. It feels good and works well.",4
"Don't usually do wire free but this is turning out to be one of my favorite weekend bras.",4
"Love this bra, very comfortable, but runs way too small. Wish I could wear it, but tried two sizes, still too small.",4
"This is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn. The band around the body and the shoulder straps are all soft and stretchy. If you are looking for comfort, this is the one for you!\nIt would get an excellent rating except for this one problem:\nOut of 5 bras, two broke within 5 washings. On both the plastic piece that you adjust the shoulder strap with cracked in half. The merchandiser replaced both bras, but I am worried that it is a flaw in the making of this particular bra.",4
"This bra is very comfortable and does not allow nipples to show through. I only wish the shoulder straps could be shortened a bit more. I have them as tight as they can go and can't quite get as much lift as I'd like. Despite that, this bra is so much more comfortable than my underwire bra that gives perfect lift, that I'm choosing to wear this bra instead.",4
"I like the fit just do not like the under wire feel.",4
"This bra is very easily snagged. Other than that it is so comfortable! I don't even feel like I have it on.",4
"For 20 years I've worn nothing but Bali Double Support or Double Support Lace. Then they changed the straps and the new straps dig and cut my shoulders. So I went on a mission to find a new favorite style. I ordered four different styles of Playtex bras and so far, this one is my favorite. My only complaint is that the bottom band rolls up. But overall the comfort can't be beat!",4
"I love this bra because it fits my bulges and does not bind.",4
"I bough several Playtex bras and this was the only one I kept. It is very supportive - I wear a 44D - but sometimes the underband will rollup on me. Just the way I am built, I guess. But it is very comfortable and I can wear it all day. have a little better luck with underwire bras with no bands, however at the end of the day I usually want my bra OFF to give \",4
"This is the first bra of this price point that has long enough straps. This is not a concealer bra. It can be worn all day. It is, however, made from artificial fibers that do not breathe like cotton and will cause sweating if you are sensitive to these fibers.",4
"I bought one of these last year for working out. It was so comfortable (for a bra, which, by its nature, is UNcomfortable), that when the style I normally wear finally wore out, I replenished with this style only. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because, well, it's a bra.",4
"I can breathe again, no underwire. Feels so good even after 18 hrs. Ok design. Uplift could be better (38AAA) but I prefer comfort over appearance for this senior!",4
"The only problem is that the left strap keeps falling down and I don't know why. I have shortened it.",4
"I have had this bra about 3 weeks , I like how it fits and does not ride up.",4
"I have bought this bra before and I wear them most of the time.",4
"Comfortable, great fit and support. Has several colors and is perfect selection for large breasted women.",4
"Happy with fit and comfort. Would order more when needed",4
"This bra is the most comfortable one I own. It's great for the changes one goes through during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, there's nowhere near enough padding to avoid nipple show through. That makes it useless for me to wear outside the house.",4
"more comfortable than underwire bras...(I don't like being forced to elongate this review....tech people fix that)",4
"It was a little tight around the bottom for me, but wearable. The straps stay up and it doesn't make a uni-boob which I hate! This is a pretty good bra.",4
"I have been buying this style for years and find it a pleasure to wear for exercise, outdoor work, etc. Looks fine too. I prefer an underwire for dressier wear, but always have this 18hour style for anything else.",4
"Now that I'm a mom and just finished weaning my son, my needs in a bra have changed. This bra is very comfortable. I like the wider bands around the chest. There's still plenty of support and no underwire which I love. But sexy? This bra is not sexy. However it does fit true to size and is my go-to bra to wear to work and running errands.",4
"This bra is comfortable. Great for someone who needs to move around a lot. Need longer straps, though. I find the straps too short on all the 18 hour bras.",4
"I was looking for a \",4
"This bra is very comfortable and easy to move in. Could use a little more support on the sides as you can see in the photo.",4
"Bra ran a little big on the band size, but still a good bra for regular daily use. Good support and very comfortable! Would definitely buy again, maybe in a smaller size.",4
"I bought this simply because I loved the pale lilac color. True to cup size, comfortable straps, supportive. What you'd expect from Playtex. I prefer other styles of Playtex wirefree, but I don't regret buying this for the color alone!",4
"I ordered this bra a little larger than usual and am glad. The cup is a little smaller than am used to. It is very comfortable otherwise.",4
"Haven't worn Playtex in years....good support...will try this style again",4
"I too have several of these bras and love them, however, this bra in black doesn't come in my size of 44 DDD. I wish that JMS would stock this size.",4
"I am a 42DD, and the bra fit perfectly. No cleavage. The fabric is breathable and is very nice for the summer. The only drawback is that it needs modesty pads if you are wearing anything clingy, but I didn't find that a deal breaker with this bra because it keeps everything in place comfortably. I could wear this bra all day without feeling like I needed to tear it off when I went to bed.",4
"This bra is super comfortable. It moves with you and keeps me cool with great support. What I don't like is the wide straps. I wear pretty standard tank tops so the shoulders are wider, but there is no way to hide the straps. I think they should be narrow enough for support and comfort. Narrowing these 1/2 of an inch would make a great difference in the no show effect.",4
"Finally a bra that covers me. I don't always want cleavage bearing bras, ya know? Comfortable beyond belief and nice support. The soft lilac color is very pretty :)",4
"The bra arrived sooner than expected, and in good shape, well packaged. The bra fits well and seeems true to size. The straps are comfortable. The band is comfortable. The only reason I did not give this bra a five-star rating is that I wish it had just a bit more support. Otherwise, the bra is a good bra, and I woul most probably buy it again.",4
"The fit and support are good. It's very comfortable and will be my main bra style, now that Bali has dropped Double Support Lightly Lined. But the straps are so long! All women under 5'2\",4
"It is comfortable, no binding, rolling, or straps slipping. I usually have a problem with straps sliding down my shoulders, but not with this one. Support is suitable. The color is very pale ~ I got the pink ~ but still shows through a white shirt.",4
"I was sick of \",4
"Buying a bra is hard enough, buying one online is nearly impossible. I am VERY HAPPY with this bra. It is comfortable, and provides good support. My only two complaint is that I wish I could get it in black and the front is cut pretty high so I cannot wear it with everything.\nBut if you want something supportive and comfortable at the same time, this is it!",4
"I ordered over $200 worth of sports bras from JMS. This $15 bra was the cheapest price of the lot. It was also the ONLY ONE that fit me in the cup, the band and the arms, AND provided reasonable support. I'm just getting back to the gym; I do treadmill and weights. So I don't need enough support to kickbox or run a marathon. This bra gives me the support I need. Yes, the band does roll a bit, and the profile isn't super flattering, but for what I need, the fit and price are great! I'll take more thanks~!",4
"After searching and trying numerous styles and brands, including the dreaded under wire, I have finally found my perfect bra. This bra is without a doubt the most comfortable bra I have ever worn. The fit is perfect and I feel pretty when I wear it. Please consider making it in black. Every women needs a black bra.",4
"I have quite a few of these bras because they are comfortable. The only problem I have found is the fabric starts to pill after prolonged usage.",4
"I was pleased when I purchased this bra for working out. It is very comfortable and does not bug me while I work out like other sports bras (you know how you have to fix them from time to time ugh!). I made sure I kept the item # this time so I could order the correct bra.",4
"I found this bra very comfortable and feels nice and light. I hesitate to purchase new bras online without trying one like it on but this time it was a hit!",4
"I am grateful to find this cotton garment. It has made the extra hot summer much more bearable. All parts that touch the skin are smooth and comfortable. Glad to be able to purchase a DDD through this site as I can never find them in stores. Delivered quickly. Lilac is pretty. The only thing keeping me from saying 5 stars is I wish there was a little more separation. For an \",4
"Best Bra I have had in years love the fit and comfort for over 18hrs . now I need a couple more",4
"I feel like I am not wearing a bra when I have this one. It does NOT roll up. Just an all around great bra!!",4
"I REALLY hate the 4 hooks! Otherwise I love the bra. It feels great when it's on and it's comfortable. It would be nice to advertise that there are 4 hooks. I personally avoid buying bras with 4 hooks because they are difficult for me to put on and take off.",4
"The style of this bra is way above others that I have tried. It has the necessary lift in the cups that I need with a larger size . I found it to be a little tight around the middle but since I can't go up 1/2 a size I will just have to deal with it. I do wish you had half sizes since 2 sizes can be too much. Overall I am pleased with this bra and would buy it again and suggest it to any one as a good buy.",4
"Have bought this item before, saw this great price and no shipping cost could not pass this up, thanks Hanes for doing this for your customers!",4
"Very happy with this purchase, I got the warm steal and it is comfortable, straps are not wide, which is exactly what I wanted, it's very pretty and gives me the modesty I wanted, and yes you can wear under plain t-shirts and the lace does not show up bumpy.",4
"The bras I received are nice but they are not what was described. I wanted unlined...no padding... But they do have a thin padding",4
"I am very pleased with this bra. My only complaint is that sometimes the underwire makes a noise.",4
"It fits nicely and hugs your breasts well. Gives a sexy feeling.",4
"I have lots of trouble with the stays breaking!\nI love the way the bra feels and fits!",4
"The bra is so pretty but also has support. I like its' look and fit so much that I now have purchased 3.",4
"I like the Bali and Platex bras. And I do like the prices.",4
"I really like the fit of the bra. I don't really care for the underwire but am hoping I will get used to. The bra is visually pretty.",4
"Lovely bra but returned because of size issues. Would recommend.",4
"The fit is pretty good, but I think I will like the one I have on back order better.",4
"I love this bra. It is very comfortable and very pretty.",4
"This bra is beautiful and supportive, although at a \",4
"I first bought this in the store. Loved it so i irdered more on line!",4
"This is a great bra for my figure. It covers everything and lifts and separates the way I like.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it would be great if the same bra could be made with a lighty padded smooth cup for wearing under T-shirts!",4
"I wish it came in more colors in my size, white and gray, not enough!!!",4
"So love my embroidered bra. The fit was perfect and not so much padding that I look stuffed or feel uncomfortable . I would recommend it to other plus women.",4
"fits nice has a little to much padding for me but like the bra.",4
"Very comfortable, but wish it didn't have the padding in the cups.",4
"Its hard to find cute bras in my size, 44B, but this is super cute and comfy! I have no complaints really, I'm just picky about the shape of cups. This one is the nicest I could find but they still have a faint cone shape in the middle. Other than that, perfect fit!",4
"Don't waste money buying the Medela one. This one fits much better as it is adjustable.",4
"This bra has been so helpful for pumping at work. I don't know what I would do without it. I like that the size is adjustable, so it can fit anyone..",4
"As I'm in my final trimester, I have yet to use this bustier. However, I have been comparing it to others that I have seen & can honestly say that this one appears to be much better constructed than others on the market. The price point is very comparable to others but might be cheaper on Target.com if you're purchasing a large $$ amount [...] friend of mine highly recommends a hands-free bustier for pumping & sends all of her NICU moms to purchase one from the gift shop in the hospital & all of the moms rave about it. So, that leads me to think that this item is going to be very invaluable in the future.",4
"I am happy with this hands free bra. I love that you can adjust to a different size. I also like that you can have the zipper either starting at the top or bottom. This one is definitely worth the money compared to others on the market.",4
"I am an exclusive pumper, so I use this bra a lot. It fits comfortably and has the option to include shoulder straps. My washer ate the zipper though :( Also, I believe the price is cheaper on Amazon than it is through Target.",4
"It was nice to have my hands free to read, snack or fold the laundry.",4
"The hands free pumping bra is prefect for the working mom. I am able to continue checking email or read documents while pumping. This makes it much easier to not skip a pumping session knowing I can still get things done.",4
"Does a great job of holding up heavy flanges + milk filled bottles. Completely hands free and no worries that it will slip or sag. For all day wear it is less than ideal, especially in warm climates. Also provides minimal support for your breasts.",4
"This product is a great help as I am exclusively pumping and appreciate being able to use my hands while pumping. It allows me to continue to work while at work or relax while pumping at home instead of holding my arms up for 20+ minutes every three hours.\n\nThe drawback is one size does not fit all in the width between breasts. I had to go to the Lansioch website to order an extra panel for the front before it worked properly. The panel was only $3 but it was a pain to have to make a second order and wait again for the shipment.",4
"I am really happy with my purchase. I wish these sizes are sold in stores, but that is the way things are. The bra sits in place , and adjustable for the perfect fit. I would recommend this bra to any mom.",4
"So the awesome thing about this bra is that it's expandable. It actually comes with two pieces so it can expand to the right size. On the down side, even at it's longest it is still feels a little tight for my 38B postpartum. \n\nIt works great to hold my pump flanges so I have hands free pumping and can take care of my baby while pumping (or whatever else I need to do). The fabric is nice and soft so it doesn't feel like it's ripping my skin off. I also like that it comes with optional straps that can be worn multiple ways or not at all.",4
"This bra works ok for a hands free pump. Not very comfortable to wear all day. This bra has extras from the medulla bra which ends up getting in the way. I do like the zipper change though.",4
"I had my mother in law buy me a nursing bra because I could not find one I liked in the store. This is a pretty full figure nursing bra ( I wear a 40F) with some light padding. (It's hard to tell my true size now as my sizes keeps changing) Very comfortable and easy to use. the cups are shaped nicely and there is no underwire. Overall it's a great bra. My reason for not 5 stars - I wanted black!",4
"I like this bra, but by the end of the day it feels like it is really digging in.",4
"Since my son was born I have been struggling with finding a comfortable bra. This one was perfect-enough support without any discomfort. I especially love how cozy the fabric is.",4
"I ordered this for the colored straps. They are almost the same as white though in the grey so that didn't work out perfectly for me. However, I like the bra. I have smallish, firm breasts and this doesn't conform to them quite as well as my favorite bra, but still it's not bad.",4
"I'm a 38C and bought size L about a year ago. At first I didn't like it much but as I wore it more and it conformed more to my body it has become a favorite. It's comfy, provides moderate support, and still looks good under clothes. In short, it's a happy medium between a sports bra (great for utility, bad for fashion) and an underwire (looks good under clothes, bad for chores that involve a lot of movement). Bonus: it's cool enough to wear during summer due to the cotton used in the fabric. Extra Bonus: the straps adjust in the FRONT so you don't have to take it off if you need to move them up or down.",4
"Been buying these for years and wearing them for the beach, the pool, and where-ever swimsuits are okay. :D",4
"i got 2 of these about a month ago, it is one of the most comfortable bras i have. i just ordered a couple more. I have problems finding one i like in the store. i saved this so i don't have to try to locate it again. very happy with product and service",4
"I am a unfortunately tiny-breasted (barely A) woman and have the worst time finding brad that fit, much less that are also comfortable and look good under clothes. I have actually been wearing pretty much one bra every day for several years because I could't find what I needed. I found this bra today and almost cried. It fits PERFECTLY, is comfy AND looks great under everything. I am going to order 10 more just so I don't have to worry about them being discontinued one day! My ONLY beef is that they don't come in a silkier fabric -- only cotton. Maybe Hanes will make a sexier one in the future -- even small ladies want to feel sexy. :-)",4
"This bra is comfortable, but I feel like it doesn't fit me properly. I buy the ComfortFlex items rather often and I always get an XL, but this seems like my breast can't fill the cup up properly. I know if I bought it in a L, it would have been too small. Still a comfortable bra and I'll wear it, but I hate that feeling of \",4

"This is a thin knit cotton bra. It's good for casual wear and it's ok for me (A cup) but there is not much support if you are bigger. If you have nipples they will show. It's a good natural looking casual bra, one step up from not wearing anything. Kind of like wearing a tank top but with bra construction",4
"I was delighted to find the ComfortFlex Fit convertible bra available at the Hanes website, because I had purchased several in stores over the past few years & wanted more. However the fabric is different, thinner, & the bra itself is slightly smaller in overall coverage. Nevertheless, this bra suits me because I detest bras with any wires in them. These are comfortable, supportive for a modestly-endowed female & reasonably priced. Size large has slightly wider straps & back closure & maybe a little more coverage.",4
"These are comfortable & affordable bras. Stretch & move like should. Cup size fit is great. Just took a while to get them!",4
"Love these bras and hope they arent discontinued! I ordered the grape but color is more like a lilac.",4
"The material is excellent, the fit is incredibly comfy, however, it was too big! At 36C, I'm right on the line for sizing between medium and large, and since I was ordering the bra for comfort, I decided to size up. However, while incredibly comfortable, the bra provides no support. I think that's because it's too big.\nHaving said that, I ordered two of them, and instead of sending back, I decided to store them in my sock drawer since I'm coming up on the pregnancy years and I think these will be perfect.",4
"Very comfortable bra that fits much better than many sport bras. Good adjustable support that I can wear all day and not notice it's there. Only complaint are the two clips at the front. They would be great for a nursing mother since they allow the cup to open from the front. Since I am not a nursing mother .... they are plastic with rough edges they sometimes scratch my skin if I move the wrong way.",4

"Unsatisfied with the traditional bras that dig into my shoulders, I decided to try the t-back bra. After researching this type of bra on various sites, I found the price and style from Hanes suited me best. I wore the bra for the first time last week and I absolutely love it. It fits me very well and the straps are comfortable. I'll don't expect to ever go back to traditional bras. I plan to purchase several more.",4
"Very pretty, and mostly comfortable. Tends to have the straps slide up near my neck and shows.",4
"I have trouble with back fasteners now and this is the first time I've tried a front closure bra and I'm so glad I went with this one. I love the feminity of the lace in the back and the good support I get from the lightly padded cup. The fit is true to size.",4

"I have worn these for bras for about 6-7 years, and I like the coverage I get from them, and I really only like the feel of cotton bras, but man, the elastic they use on these straps I HATE. It is so dowdy and grand-ma, I hate if they show ever when wearing a t-shirt of something shifts. If I could find another bra that fit like these, I would not wear them again. The nubbins on the elastic overtime, get rougher, sometimes I think grab onto lint in the dryer, and they become scratchy. i have tried trimming it off, but then the fabric just wants to run. And why only in heather gray, why not black or an exciting color. It is hard to find a cotton bra with this level of engineering for a firm fit.

My only complaints are minor: the use of plastic (as opposed to metal) adjusters on the straps.

"I was nervous about ordering online, I'm a DD and went to a DDD after becoming pregnant. Ordering any kind of bra is annoying for me. I figured this would be like wearing a sports bra but it's much more comfy than one! And it also doesn't smash my boobs like sports bras do!",4
"I ordered this about a week before I had my daughter, and unfortunately am unable to nurse. However, I do wear this around the house because it is super comfortable. I may even use it as a workout bra as it fits me similarly to a sports bra.",4

"This is one style that I love. The comfort of the cotton material is quite soft yet it holds everything in place. My only reason for not giving a 5 its because I wish there were some bright colours but mostly because the band is quite snug. I purchased the 36C which became uncomfortably tight at the band. There was no 38B in the sizes and I was really not prepared to purchase any size larger as it would be so much more expensive to return so I later resorted to purchasing some extenders. While I'm it could you say if onehanes sells bra\nextenders? Other than this adjustment",4

The straps stay put and they make my poor old droopy girls look nice.\n\nWhile still a plus-sized woman, I have lost over 100 pounds so everything is sagging.

"During the summer, this is my go-to bra. It is very supportive (I'm a D cup), yet being made of cotton, it is cool enough to wear when the temperature and humidity spike.\nI only gave it 4 stars, because it doesn't hold up well after numerous washings. However that fact hasn't deterred me from purchasing this bra, and I simply have replaced the worn out ones with new ones. I hope they keep this one around for a long time!",4

"I love this bra. Love the cotton fabric. It has a good fit. Doesn't ride up. Straps stay in place & don't fall off of your shoulder. The size does run a little large. But I just went down one size & fit was fine.\nI only wish Playtex would offer it in more colors. This bra would probably be a bigger seller than what it is if they would offer it in more colors. It is a very comfortable bra. And it holds up well wash after wash. It is now my favorite bra.",4
"It has been hard to find a bra that was flattering to my look. Decided to try my first underwire bra ever. It separated and shaped nicely. However, it's not as comfortable after wearing it for many hours as the 18-hour bras but it's comfortable enough, especially because it looks so good.",4
"I love this bra but would like to see it in taupe, pink and black.\nWhy don't you make it in colors?",4
"These bras are comfortable but have no support, especially for a large bust. They are fine for around the house but in public a better bra is needed. They are lightweight and great in hot weather.",4
"I like the way this bra fits and it is very comfortable. However my one complaint is they smelled musty and really strong! I am going to try again to wash out the smell and hope I have good luck.",4
"If you want a comfy bra you can wear under a few layers, this bra is great. However, it is not padded, so you will easily show through under a Tshirt!",4
"I am a 36DD (dress size 14) and I like to sleep in a soft bra. I bought the Bandini is a size XL (the 2 pack, black and white) and they came yesterday. Super comfortable and fine to sleep in. I think I could've used a size L though. Definitely won't be leaving the house in this one. Not enough support (even for sweats on a Saturday) in the size XL. I'm thinking that if I'd ordered the L, it might be a good comfy bra for out and and about.\n\nFYI, the white bra is fairly sheer. I definitely wouldn't wear this under a white shirt.",4
"This would be great if you made a 3x, I bought 2x and 1 fits smaller than the other. I am usually a 38.",4
"These bras are very comfortable and love the colors they come in! I am small & this bra tends to flatten but didn't expect it to do much anyway or enhance. It does seem to support but not sure if it would for bigger chests. Great at home bra or sleeping bra for those who need it. Love the different ways you can wear it!",4

I've been having to wear racerback bras since the early 90's and I thought I would just take a chance and see what happened.\n\nI wear A-shirts around the house all of the time, including out in the yard doing work. But living in FL with the heat and humidity and bras just don't mix! But I'm too big and too old (gravity) to go out in public without a bra on. And those built in shelf bras are a joke!\n\nSo, I bought a (L) large. I've had it on for about an hour now.\n\nSo far, the band is staying down.

It is a very comfortable bra for my workouts and around the house. I got the teal and purple. The colors are pretty and look cute when the straps show under my workout clothes.",4
"cannot give top rating because hanes products are not american made",4
"When I first bought Bandinis a couple years ago, they were ideal as a leisure or nighttime bra - soft and comfortable. (They were never made to provide specialty shaping or support). However the sets I've bought this year (2013) have had such short straps, they were actually painful to wear and even tough to put on. I would still recommend them for leisure use, but now only for a petite or shorter-waisted women.",4
"I love how comfortable these bras are. Quality is great too! They do run small in size however.",4
"Only regret, it is not lined as the similar product I ordered is.",4
"I am a 75B ordered size S according to the size chart and found it way too small. Need to re-order a size M instead. Otherwise, every other aspect of the bras are excellent. My recommendation is to order one size bigger than your regular bras.",4
"I'm giving The Bandini 4 stars, because even though it's not the greatest bra in the world, it's a good bra for the price. I wear a 40C, ordered the XL size, and it fits perfectly with average support. I really like the overall shape of the bra and how it makes my breasts look. It's very attractive! The bra lifts and separates better than my other sports bras, but I do 'show through' it because there is no extra lining or padding, so beware of that. I personally would not wear this bra out for anything beyond comfy casual dress. My padded bras are more flattering for when I want to dress to impress. However, this is an incredibly comfortable choice for hanging around the house. I initially wasn't sure I wanted to order the Bandini because another review mentioned that it was just a piece of spandex. Now that I've worn it, I have to say: It's not a bra that's going to last forever. I will probably have to replace it in a year -- but, with a 2-pack for this price, what more can you expect? I'm very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it to you.",4

"It has been unseasonably warm this spring (hot and humid in March!), and my molded-cup bras are too hot and my unlined lace ones get scratchy when I sweat. I wasn't really even looking for a solution when I saw these on sale. Lightweight, fairly breathable, colorful and convertible! The racerback style disappears under my favorite tanks. I will say that these bras (and also perhaps because I got a smaller size) create a bulge at my arm pit that's less than flattering and flatten the breasts a little. I am a 34C and actually got a size smaller than the chart suggested so that I could have a little extra hold. Adequate support for a lazier day (no amusement parks or hiking).",4
"Lightweight but full coverage under the sheerest of clothing.",4

"These are very cute and the fabric is soft. Wish the hook where the straps meet the band had something to pad them from your skin. They tend to dig in. Still a great bra for the price.",4
"I have been wearing this bra for a many years. There is no reason for me to try another. When I first bought this style, I was told that it was the most popular selling bra ever and I know why. The t-shirt moniker means it is invisible under anything you wear and the support never lets you down. It starts out just a bit snug but quickly gets comfortable and stays that way for a long time. Near the end of the life, it is a bit stretched out but I have only had one wire poke through in maybe two dozen different colors over the years. It is the only bra I have ever been able to wear all day. Don't ever stop making it Maidenform!",4
"I absolutely love this bra. I am a borderline A cup and this bra fits better than most of my regular bras. It does an outstanding job of lifting and separating and an even better job of creating cleveage. Worn correctly, this product does an amazing job of transforming the itty bittys into gorgeous looking ta tas.  \n\nAmazed that the adhesive remains as sticky as it was when I purchased  in the summer of 2010.\n\nThe reason I'm not giving this product an overall rating of five stars is because this product does not come in the color black.  That crucial especially for us women of color.  Dark women require black bras to be worn underneath white or any light color tops or dresses.",4

It's listed as small, medium, large, etc.  In store these, same exact thing, are sized by cup A, B, C, etc.  So if I normally purchase the C cup, do I order the medium or the large?\n\nI love these and prefer to wear them to a normal bra, but I can't find them in the store anymore.  I've seen them other places online for up to 60 bucks, so the price is awesome here as well.  I gave four stars merely for the fact that the sticky becomes not so much sooner than I'd prefer.",4
"I specifically bought this product for my dance recital. It was pretty easy application and comfortable. However, once I started sweating it began to unstick a little. I will still use it, but maybe not for such sweaty activities. Btw, I am 16 and I am usually a A cup, sometimes B, but I went with the B and it fit well. Overall good product.",4

"I recently purchased two of the Comfort Devotion bras, and am happy to say that I am, overall, quite satisfied with these products. If you are looking for comfortable, full-coverage bras to purchase--that are also very cute and feminine--search no further! I would highly recommend these bras.",4
"Very comfotable bra with nice coverage that has a pretty touch of lace which is unusual in a tshirt bra",4

"I was looking for sports bras that are comfortable to hang around the house in. These are good for that! The model is wearing two sports bras in the picture at one time. I am a 36DD and purchased these in an XL. They don't offer much support but I wasn't expecting them to. They are comfortable where you don't feel like you're wearing a bra at all!",4
"I have enjoyed wearing my new bras. I am small breasted and I don't like a lot of the bras with bulky padding inside the cups but these are comfortable and fit me well. I just wish this style had more variety of colors... Pretty girl colors.",4

"I've tried strapless bras before. This is, by far, better than any I've had. It lifts and shapes in a natural looking way. It doesn't make the shape look odd like others have. I've worn it without the straps, only, and it stays in place and looks smooth all day. It is much cheaper at Walmart compared to the on-line price.",4

"Love this bra. Just wish it came in more colors in my size.",4
"Bought this online-so did not try on. I am keeping it-it is really pretty. However it is a bit stiff and the underwire in the center of the chest comes up so far is feels like it sticks out. Hoping it loosens up after a while.",4
"Having lost weigh,I needed to buy bras that fit. I was looking for a bra that would keep the breast tissue from coming out under the wire. This bra does an okay job. I really like the different colors that are available.",4
"So far I really like this bra. It lifts me up yet keeps me contained. I worry that the back will not hold up in the long run as it is fairly thin material, but I will hope. I have only worn it a couple of times.",4
"I bought sating tracings for the comfort of the shoulder straps. I like the soft fabric.\nThe fit is OK--back should have 4 hooks with wider fabric. The front of the bra where the cleavage is does not lay properly, pops up, and does not give smooth look--there's a buldge in the center of the bra. Not a good look for sweaters and knit tops. I've been wearing the flower bali, but the shoulder straps are uncomfortable and cut into the top of my shoulder. The bali bra should have the shoulder strap that bali satin tracings has and the satin tracings should have the 4 hooks the flower bali has, plus a smoother fit by the cleavage that the flower bali has. You could combine both of the features for one good bra, keeping the soft fabric from the bali satin tracings. Arlene Kacvinski",4
"I purchased two of the Bali Satin Tracings Underwire Minimizer bras about two weeks ago. Very happy with the fit and support this style gives. The cups fit well (for once!), and the underwires are comfortable.\nThe color (a dark taupe) is a plus, as I'm a darker-skinned woman. All in all, this is a really good bra, gotten at a really great price.",4
"Best fitting bra I've ever had it truly minimizes and is very comfortable to wear I also ordered smaller around measurement and larger cup measurement than I normally order",4
"Really wanted a wire free minimizer, but this didn't do what I wanted. I will stick with the underwires.",4
"Great Bra for big busted women. I buy at least 8 per year! Only wish they made colors other than white in the larger sizes 44dd+",4
"I purchase a Bali Minimizer every three months and they never fit the same even though I have not lost or gained weight. Sometimes they fit perfectly and the next purchase, the underwire digs into my rib cage.",4
"Great fit! It's challenging to find a great fitting bra.",4
"Bali, when are you going to make this bra in colors? Only white harks back to the 1940's.",4
"This bra comes in my size and actually fits pretty well. It's comfortable too. I do wish the larger sizes were available in different colors. Large women need black bras too!",4
"This is actually the main bra that I wear. I have one other, which is a Glamorise that I wear for sports but otherwise all my bras are of this type, so I own more than 15 of these. I love their fit, however, I too have a problem with the pointy bone in the front, and the lack of the lovely blue color in my size (44G). I think all the lovely colors should be made for every size and something should be done about the pointy bone in the front. Otherwise I love love love this bra.",4
"Bought this bra at an excellent price! It's very comfortable with the padded straps and I lkie the variety of colors! I've been buying this Nali bra f or over 15 years! I'd recommend it to people!",4
"Brought this bra, some months ago! I love it. I even wear it for exercises and it holds the twins just the way I want. I want to buy all of the colors shades.",4
"this was the first time I bought a bra without trying on first. I guessed at the correct size and it just fit.",4
"Love these bras! Wish more colors were available ... especially---NAVY BLUE .I have read many reviews and it seems like more color choices are always mentioned....why can't more colors be available in these sizes???? Is anybody listening????",4
"I am generally not a fan of under-wires, but really needed a minimizer bra to wear under lighter summer clothing. This bra is surprisingly comfy, and does a great job minimizing. Also true to size",4
"I like that the straps don't dig into my shoulders.",4
"This is a great minimizer bra. It also lifts and holds perfectly . I have very large heavy breast and they don't sag in This 'go to ' bra. It's also slimming.\nMy only complaint... The little bow. It rubs against the fabric of my clothing and makes a noticeable Mark. It either looks like I spilled something or that area is worn. Considering I can't find this type of lift in any other minimizer ...\nIt is what it is. I will continue to buy them and snip off the bow.",4
"I've been wearing this bra for many years now, usually purchased at retail stores. Lately, the quality has deminished, as I have the same problem as others had said. The underwire pocks thru the fabric usually at the underarm and I actually had them pock thru in the front as well. Whoever they outsource too to make this product need to up their quality or they stand to loose longtime customers",4
"I bought the bali satin tracings underwire minimizer bra about a month ago an it is so nice to wear",4
"I had to go up a size, I am 37DD. The 38 is a bit big, hoping it will shrink a bit. Otherwise a very good buy!",4
"This is supposed to be a minimizer bra, and does fit well. However, I don't feel as if it really functions as a minimizer. I feel that my shirts are tighter now, than before I got these bras.",4
"The bra was the size I always wear. The cup size was perfect, the straps were comfortable but the band was too small and I had to return it.",4
"Love the comfort of the straps. Fit is pretty accurate. Comfortable underwire.",4
"Good price, nice bra. It has good support, and has washed well.",4
"The color was nice and quality is good, but the band size felt a little snug. I would suggest ordering an inch or two higher.",4
"This is the third similar bra that I have purchased. Fits well, washes well, many colors.",4
"I have purchased Bali Bras for many years and they are good bras. However, I bought 2 of the same style and size and one is much tighter than the other. Just be aware they run a little small. I still like them and they are made well.",4
"Love the support & what it does for my figure, just wish it was sized a bit bigger.",4
"I have been buying from Hanes for many years. I always come back.",4
"I have tried many other brand bras in the past\nbut none fits as goods as Bali.",4
"This has been my go-to bra for years for support, but it does come with compromises. I am 5'4\",4
"Looks great under t-shirts and knit things. Give a good line for this \",4
"Fits well, good support and long lasting. Its just a tad too\nhigh at the top by the little bow, maybe 1 cm shorter\nwould be better. it sticks out in some outfits.",4
"I love the new sheer latte color. The metal prongs that hold the bra in the back are too soft and bend too easily.",4
"I have been buying this bra for a VERY long time. It is the only one that supports my 5'1\",4
"I was a little leery on the purchase, but was happy after I tried on and wore the bra. It was quite comfortable and supportive to my surprise. It looked nice under clothing as well. A great bra for the money.",4
"Try as I might, I can't seem to find a more supportive, comfortable bra. I only wish more color variety was available at all times.",4
"I bought this because I can't find my size in stores.",4
"This bra does what it is supposed to do, it supports well",4
"I had been searching for a bra with straps that would stay up. This bra works great and I'm happy with it.",4
"It is rare for me to get a well-fitting bra without trying several different sizes. Looking for an affordable bra, I decided to purchase one online. I was amazed that it fit so well!",4
"I've been zaftig my whole life and this bra holds the girls up safely and securely. My only complaint is that the elastic fabric wears out too soon.",4
"Got a 34 G and it fits VERY well\nJust a little itchy sometimes and the top of it goes up pretty far. Good for a comfy bra but you can't wear it with cute blouses",4
"I already have this bra that I brought at another retailer but, they were cheaper here I love it.",4
"It gives me the support that I need. I would buy this product again.",4
"Great features. I, like many others who have commented here, and that wear larger sizes, would like some other colors!!! Teal, or red, or hot pink. Bali is a multimillion-dollar business! You can't add some color to the vat and give more color choices? Really?",4
"Have worn this bra for quiet a while now. Will order more as you get different colors.",4
"Periodically, try all the large size bras at local large dept. store and still find that this is the only bra I can get a good fit. I have worn this style for many years. Unfortunately, like other reviews, in the last 2 years every bra after washing has little clumps in them. Some sort of reinforcement fabric from the sewing of the bras. When I wear my nice polyester dress blouses there are little bumps showing on my breasts. I have to sit and loosen the bumps and work the clumps to bottom and sides.\n\nAlso, I have a black bra I don't wear as often, so have had it longer. I notice the cups and general fit of this bra is better than the last 6 bras I have brought. The underwire do stick out as far so, no bump in the middle of your chest. Wish Bali would figure why the cup and underwire was better 2 or 3 years ago, and why there fabric or paper clumps in between the outer and inner layer of cups.",4
"The bra fit correctly, the straps are great, it actually serves as a minimizer without making the wearer feel like she's in a whalebone corset! Only beef is the the tags are hard to get off. Ended having to use nail scissors for the front tag and even that couldn't get to the threads without cutting off the bow. Not a deal breaker but annoying.",4
"I am a 36DDD and this is the only bra that provides the support & fit I need. The first thing I do when I receive a new one is to cut off the bow on the front, as it protrudes under knit tops. This bra has a tendency to cut in on the bottom front center, so I fold a small piece of fleece fabric over that portion. I have tried many other bra styles and I always come back to this one. The padded straps are wonderful. I would highly recommend this bra; especially to large busted women.",4
