    "The list is more similar to a classic array(such as C++ vectors), where the set is based on the Mathematical concept of a Set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list has a focus on being able to store a series of elements in a specific order, and accessing to these elements is very fast if we know their index. This makes them ideal when we want to access every element. In Python specifically, lists are also fast when appending elements to the end, but slow when we want to insert elements at the front as we have to move all the elements that are after the insertion. \n",
    "One use case would be processing a series of n elements, where the processing is individual and independent. We can simply iterate through the list and each access will be done in constant time; the cost of going over the list will be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The set has a focus on the basic operations defined for mathmatical sets: union, intersection, belonging, difference... This makes it ideal for cases where we precisely want to know the result of this operations and it is organized like a dictionary(hashmap) to check belonging faster, so we have no idea in which order the elements appear. An use case would be two groups of n elements and finding the common elements between the two groups. The way sets are organized, this would only take linear time on each set so the computational cost would be the sum of the size of both."
